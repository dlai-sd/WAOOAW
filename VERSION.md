# WAOOAW Platform Version History

## v0.2.1 - Message Bus Architecture (December 27, 2025)

**Status:** BASELINE - Communication Infrastructure Design Complete

**What's New:**
- ✅ Message Bus Architecture designed (Redis Streams-based)
- ✅ Complete message schema (routing, payload, metadata, audit)
- ✅ 5 message routing patterns (point-to-point, broadcast, topic, request-response, self)
- ✅ Priority handling (1-5 scale via 5 separate streams)
- ✅ At-least-once delivery with acknowledgment
- ✅ 2-year message retention + replay capability
- ✅ Separate audit trail design (PostgreSQL, 7-year compliance)
- ✅ Dead Letter Queue for failed messages
- ✅ Redis persistence verification & gap analysis

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Technology**: Redis Streams (already in infrastructure, $0 cost)
- **Delivery**: At-least-once with consumer groups + pending entries
- **Scale**: 10K msg/day, 1K burst/sec (easily scales to 100K+)
- **Persistence**: AOF + RDB for durability
- **Audit**: Separate PostgreSQL store for compliance

**Redis Configuration Gaps Identified:**
- ⚠️ No AOF (Append-Only File) configured - needs `--appendonly yes`
- ❌ No memory limits - needs `--maxmemory 2gb`
- ❌ No eviction policy - needs `--maxmemory-policy noeviction`
- 📋 Action items documented in MESSAGE_BUS_ARCHITECTURE.md

**Updated Dimensions Status:**
7. Communication Protocol: 🟡 DESIGNED (50% - architecture complete, implementation pending)

**Overall Readiness:** 36% (5.4/15 dimensions)

**New Files in v0.2.1:**
```
docs/
  MESSAGE_BUS_ARCHITECTURE.md (1000+ lines)
    - Complete Redis Streams design
    - Message schema & routing patterns
    - Priority handling & DLQ
    - Audit trail design
    - Redis persistence gap analysis
    - 2-week implementation plan
```

**Implementation Plan:**
- Week 1: Core message bus + agent integration
- Week 2: Priority/DLQ + audit trail + testing
- ~800 LOC (message_bus.py + models.py + tests)

**Next Milestone:** v0.2.2 - Message Bus Implementation (Week 1)

## v0.2 - Foundation with Research Integration (December 25, 2025)

**Status:** BASELINE - Keep & Build Decision Point

**What's Included:**
- ✅ Dual-identity framework (Specialization + Personality)
- ✅ 6-step wake protocol (basic implementation)
- ✅ Base agent class (WAAOOWAgent)
- ✅ First production agent (WowVision Prime)
- ✅ Database schema (10 core tables)
- ✅ Infrastructure (PostgreSQL, Redis, Pinecone)
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline (Python linting, tests)
- ✅ Research documentation (110+ pages)

**Research Completed:**
- ✅ Systematic Literature Review - Multi-Agent Orchestration
- ✅ Agent Design Patterns at Scale (15 dimensions)
- ✅ Strategic Decision: Keep vs. Scrap Analysis

**Core 5 Dimensions Status:**
1. Wake Protocol: 🟡 PARTIAL (40% - needs event-driven upgrade)
2. Context Management: 🟡 PARTIAL (50% - needs progressive loading)
3. Identity System: 🟢 COMPLETE (100% - production ready)
4. Hierarchy: 🔴 MISSING (0% - needs CoE Coordinators)
5. Collaboration: 🟡 PARTIAL (30% - needs handoff methods)

**Advanced 10 Dimensions Status:**
6. Learning & Memory: 🟡 PARTIAL (40% - DB tables exist)
7. Communication Protocol: 🔴 MISSING (0% - needs structured messages)
8. Resource Management: 🔴 MISSING (0% - needs budgets)
9. Trust & Reputation: 🔴 MISSING (0% - needs scoring)
10. Error Handling: 🟡 PARTIAL (30% - basic try/catch)
11. Observability: 🟡 PARTIAL (20% - basic logging)
12. Security & Privacy: 🔴 MISSING (0% - needs RBAC)
13. Performance Optimization: 🟡 PARTIAL (40% - vector cache exists)
14. Testing & Validation: 🟡 PARTIAL (30% - 3 mock tests)
15. Lifecycle Management: 🔴 MISSING (0% - needs versioning)

**Overall Readiness:** 35% (5.25/15 dimensions complete)

**Go-Live Roadmap from v0.2:**
- **v0.5 (Month 3, Week 12):** Platform Go-Live - 200 agents working
- **v0.8 (Month 6, Week 24):** Marketplace Go-Live - 14 CoEs selling
- **v1.0 (Month 11, Week 46):** Operations Go-Live - All 15 dimensions

**Next Version:** v0.3 (Week 4) - Event-driven wake + Output generation

## v0.1 - Initial Prototype (December 20-24, 2025)

**Status:** DEPRECATED - Superseded by v0.2

**What Was Built:**
- Basic WowVision Prime agent
- PostgreSQL integration
- GitHub integration prototype
- Vision stack concept

**Issues:**
- No framework for multiple agents
- No identity system
- No wake protocol
- No research backing

**Outcome:** Evolved into v0.2 after research phase
