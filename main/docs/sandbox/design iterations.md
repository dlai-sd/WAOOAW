# Design Iterations Log (Sandbox)

This file is a sandbox log intended to capture **design iteration discussions, decisions, and locks**.
It is not L0/L1 authority. If it conflicts with `main/Foundation.md`, it must yield.

## 2026-01-05 — Iteration Journey (Phases 1 → 4 Completed)

### Context
- Current date: 2026-01-05
- Current user login: dlai-sd
- Goal: run one full design journey end-to-end, then adjust later with clarity (not reopen everything).

---

## Phase 1 — Design Boundaries & Language

### 1.1 Explicit Refusals (Not Now / Never)
**Locked:**
- “Not Now” horizon remains active until ME‑WoW + lifecycle are proven in controlled trials.
- Avoid premature commitments to:
  - tooling/implementation architecture
  - marketplace economics (pricing/rev-share)
  - broad cross-domain “agent DNA” beyond governance/refusal/escalation/audit
  - high-risk domain execution (health/finance/legal)

### 1.2 Language stabilization
**Locked:**
- Clarified term split:
  - **Industry** = market label
  - **Domain** = governance/risk context
  - “Outcome Arena” renamed to **Customer Need Space** (collaboration reason)

---

## Phase 2 — Minimum Executable Design (Not Building)

### 2.1 ME‑WoW (Minimum Executable Way of Working)
**Locked:**
- 10-condition completeness gate used by Genesis for Go/No-Go certification:
  1) Outcome + closure
  2) Scope boundaries + refusal classes
  3) Inputs/evidence
  4) Outputs/artifacts
  5) Interfaces named
  6) Decision rights vs approvals
  7) Critique/self-exam point
  8) Escalation triggers/destinations
  9) Safety containment (default non-executing)
  10) Auditability requirements

### 2.2 Agent lifecycle (conceptual)
**Locked states:**
- Proposed → Specified → Certified → Active (Non-Executing) → (optional) Active (Executing—Bounded) → Suspended → Retired

**Invariant:**
- Any external execution requires Governor approval.

---

## Phase 3 — Governance Under Stress

### 3.1 Failure simulation (F5: regressive evolution attempt)
Scenario: “small upgrade” attempts to add autonomous execution (e.g., auto-apply optimizations).

**Locked outcomes:**
- Bright-line Evolution rule:
  - any increase in external effects OR reduction in approvals = Evolution (re-cert required)
- Measurable “approval envelopes” norm (future):
  - if not numerical and narrow, reject

### 3.2 Success pressure simulation (“we’ll lose customer by Friday”)
Scenario: request for exceptions under revenue pressure.

**Locked rule:**
- **No exceptions without Proposal.**
- Exceptions are constitutional events, not “business decisions,” and may be refused by Vision/Architect/Genesis.

---

## Phase 4 — Design Phase Exit
**Locked:** Phase 4 accepted.

### “Dangerously expensive to change later” (must be stable)
- authority & veto structure across Vision/Architect/Genesis
- evolution classification rule
- execution approval rule
- no-exception rule
- lifecycle discipline
- vocabulary stability

### Intentionally left open (to avoid premature complexity)
- pricing/marketplace
- full autonomous execution patterns
- detailed platform tooling
- production ops automation
- high-risk domains

### Proof suite used to validate design completeness
- ME‑WoW certification drill (SEO case)
- Evolution pressure drill (F5)
- Success pressure drill (Phase 3.2)
- Suspension drill (S2)

---

## Calibration decisions (post Phase 4)

### Governor approvals (go-live)
**Locked:**
- Until first go-live with Active agents: approvals are **manual per-action clicks**.
- Later: gradual move to rule-based approvals (treated as Evolution/Proposal).

### Suspension authority
**Locked:**
- Vision Guardian / Systems Architect / Genesis may trigger suspension without Governor approval.

### Domain tiering
**Locked:**
- Introduced NOW: Low / Medium / High tiers with default strictness differences.

### Proposal routing
**Locked:**
- Agent proposal submission is controlled by a flag set by Platform Governor:
  - flag OFF: agents do not submit proposals
  - flag ON: agents may submit proposals (but cannot instantiate)

### First ME‑WoW drill object
**Locked:**
- Customer Need Space: **SEO — “Traffic but no conversions”**
- Boundary: SEO WoW produces a **CRO Handoff Package** and stops (Option 1).

---

## Suspension drill (S2): asked to publish content directly (execution pressure)

**Locked behavior:**
- Agent refuses execution and escalates for Governor approval.
- Genesis triggers Suspension if bypass pressure is present or if execution pathway is unclear.

**Standard suspension reason codes (minimum):**
- EXEC-BYPASS
- SCOPE-DRIFT
- EVIDENCE-GAP

---

## Governor split clarification (important)
**Locked split:**
- **Engagement (Customer) Governor** approves execution on customer-owned assets/content.
- **Platform Governor** approves platform policy/permissions/evolution/exceptions.

This resolved the “who approves publishing” ambiguity cleanly.
