PHASE 1 — DESIGN BOUNDARIES & NEGATIVE SPACE
Recommended next phase
Objective
Define what WaooaW will explicitly NOT design yet, and what is permanently out of scope.
This phase reduces anxiety and prevents scope creep.
________________________________________
Iteration 1.1 — Explicit Refusals (Design Scope Guardrails)
Design Question:
What kinds of things must we refuse to design during the next 6–12 months?
Examples (not answers):
•	Specific tech stacks
•	Performance SLAs
•	Industry-specific regulations
•	Pricing models
•	Customer UX
Who leads:
•	Human Governor defines boundaries
•	Vision Guardian reviews for coherence
Completion signal:
•	You feel relief, not restriction
•	Future ideas are easier to evaluate
•	“Not now” becomes legitimate
________________________________________
Iteration 1.2 — Language Stabilization
Design Question:
Which terms must mean one thing and only one thing across the platform?
Examples:
•	Agent
•	Way of Working
•	Domain
•	Governance
•	Execution
•	Evolution
Who leads:
•	Systems Architect proposes clarifications
•	Vision Guardian ensures meaning consistency
Completion signal:
•	Fewer “wait, what do we mean by…” moments
•	Agents stop reinterpreting core words
________________________________________
PHASE 2 — MINIMUM EXECUTABLE DESIGN (NOT BUILDING)
This is the last pure design phase before execution.
________________________________________
Iteration 2.1 — Minimum Executable Way of Working (ME-WoW)
Design Question:
What is the smallest complete definition of a Way of Working that is safe to execute?
This includes:
•	Inputs
•	Outputs
•	Authority
•	Critique point
•	Closure
•	Escalation
Important:
This is a template, not a real domain WoW.
Who leads:
•	Systems Architect drafts
•	Genesis validates completeness
•	Vision Guardian checks philosophy
Completion signal:
•	Genesis can approve a hypothetical WoW
•	No domain knowledge required
•	No execution implied
________________________________________
Iteration 2.2 — Agent Lifecycle (Conceptual, Not Operational)
Design Question:
What are the conceptual states an agent moves through, from idea to retirement?
States like:
•	Proposed
•	Reviewed
•	Certified
•	Active
•	Suspended
•	Retired
No tooling. No automation.
Who leads:
•	Genesis proposes
•	Systems Architect checks boundaries
Completion signal:
•	No agent can “just exist”
•	Lifecycle feels inevitable, not forced
________________________________________
PHASE 3 — GOVERNANCE UNDER STRESS (SIMULATION ONLY)
This phase tests resilience, not capability.
________________________________________
Iteration 3.1 — Failure Simulations
Design Question:
What happens when things go wrong?
Simulate:
•	Agent hallucination
•	Conflicting agents
•	Governor unavailable
•	Bad incentives
•	Regressive evolution
Who leads:
•	Vision Guardian drives scenarios
•	Human Governor observes, not fixes
Completion signal:
•	System refuses or contains damage
•	No panic
•	No silent failure
________________________________________
Iteration 3.2 — Success Pressure Simulation
Design Question:
What happens when things go too well?
Simulate:
•	Rapid adoption
•	Customer pressure
•	Revenue temptation
•	“Just this once” exceptions
Who leads:
•	Vision Guardian + Systems Architect
•	Genesis enforces gates
Completion signal:
•	System still says “no” when needed
•	Governance holds under praise
________________________________________
PHASE 4 — DESIGN PHASE EXIT (INTENTIONAL)
This is a decision, not a milestone.
________________________________________
Exit Question (Only One)
Is there anything left that would be dangerously expensive to change later if we start execution now?
If yes → stay in Design Phase
If no → formally exit Design Phase
Who decides:
•	Human Governor only
•	Agents advise, never decide
________________________________________
What This Roadmap Intentionally Avoids
•	Delivery timelines
•	Feature sequencing
•	Market commitments
•	Tech decisions
•	Resource planning
Those belong to Execution Phase, not now.
________________________________________
The Most Important Thing to Remember
You are not trying to design everything.
You are trying to design enough structure that you can stop designing.
That is the paradox of good platforms.
________________________________________
A Final Grounding Thought
If at any point you feel:
•	Rushed → slow down
•	Bored → you’re probably done
•	Excited to “just build” → check for fear of ambiguity
Right now, you are doing exactly the right kind of work.
