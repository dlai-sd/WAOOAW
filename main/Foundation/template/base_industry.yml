industry_structure:
  description: |
    An **Industry** (or Domain) is a specialization layer that adapts:
    - **Skills** → Industry-specific execution (e.g., SKILL-RESEARCH-001 uses PubMed for Healthcare, JSTOR for Education)
    - **JobRoles** → Industry boundaries (e.g., JOB-HC-001 cannot diagnose, only write content)
    - **Teams** → Compliance enforcement (e.g., TEAM-HC-001 validates HIPAA before every task)
    - **Agents** → Domain knowledge (e.g., AGT-HC-001 understands medical terminology)
