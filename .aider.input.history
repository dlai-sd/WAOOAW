+Epic Title: [EPIC] cp and pp portal start using with plant api layer with secure and robust pipe which will be used for all future api integration.
+Epic Body:
+### Business Goal
+
+Establish a foundation of strong and secure bridge / pipe between cp and pp with plant api layer.
+
+### Scope
+
+-Plant have published and deployed multiple APIs via services using FASTAPI Gateway service layer. Identify this FASTAPI implementation layer and all published apis.
+-CP and PP have user journeys, respective screens developed and deployed. At present there is no connection between cp and pp portal with plant api.
+-Enhance cp and pp portal to use appropriate APIs which are already deployed by plan using FASTAPI gateway service in secure and robust pipe which will reused in future for all integration purpose
+-No any other changes apart from this. Analysis, coding, testing and deployment shall be wordclass using best of engineering excellence practices.
+
+
+### Success Metrics
+
+-CP and PP seamlessly integrated with plant apis
+-Error and exception handling is taken care ie if plant is down, error shall be flagged to user but pp and cp shall continue to show default data with banner saying plant is down
