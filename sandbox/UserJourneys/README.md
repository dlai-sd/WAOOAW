WAOOAW Sandbox — UserJourneys
Folder: sandbox/UserJourneys

Files:
- index.html        -> Interactive single-page prototype (open in browser)
- styles.css        -> Styling and theme (deep purple + electric orange)
- script.js         -> App logic, state (localStorage), simulated pipelines & gamification
- README.md         -> This file

Usage:
1. Place the sandbox/UserJourneys folder on your web server or open index.html directly in a modern browser.
2. Interact with the role selector (top-right) to assume Customer, Creator, Service Ops, or Platform Builder roles.
3. Start a 7‑day trial, assign tasks, simulate Factory runs, create incidents, and explore orchestration.
4. Export sandbox state with "Export State" or reset sandbox with "Reset Sandbox".

Notes:
- This is a static prototype. All data is simulated and stored in localStorage.
- The UI is gamified for investor demos: XP, confetti, badges, and animated CoE interactions.
- If you want: I can produce a production-ready React version, add real API hooks, or convert to a standalone demo hosted on GitHub Pages.
