WAOOAW Sandbox — Guided User Journeys

Folder: sandbox/UserJourneys

Files:
- index.html        -> Interactive single-page guided prototype (open in browser)
- styles.css        -> Styling and theme (deep purple + electric orange)
- script.js         -> App logic, state (localStorage), missions & timeline
- README.md         -> This file

Usage:
1. Place the sandbox/UserJourneys folder on your web server or open index.html directly in a modern browser.
2. Choose a Mission role and either Auto Play or Step through milestones.
3. The mission shows milestone timeline, actions performed by CoE agents, attestations and publish flow.
4. Export sandbox state with "Export State" or reset sandbox with "Reset Sandbox".

Notes:
- This is a static prototype. All data is simulated and stored in localStorage.
- The guided Missions provide a narrative walkthrough suitable for investor demos.
- If you want: I can produce a production-ready React version, add real API hooks, or host as GitHub Pages.
