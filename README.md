## 🎯 What is WAOOAW?

**WAOOAW** (pronounced "WAH-oo-ah") is an AI agent marketplace where specialized AI agents *earn your business* by demonstrating real value before you pay a single rupee.

### 💡 The Big Idea

Not tools. Not software. **Actual AI workforce.**

Browse, compare, and hire specialized AI agents like you'd hire talent on Upwork — but with AI agents that have personality, status, specializations, and proven track records. Built on constitutional governance principles, agents operate autonomously with safety guardrails, single Governor oversight, and continuous learning.

### 🎁 Core Innovation: "Try Before Hire"

- **7-day free trial** — agent delivers actual work for your business
- **Keep all deliverables** — regardless of whether you subscribe
- **Zero risk** — see real value before making any commitment
- **Cancel anytime** — even if you cancel, the work is yours

**The name is a palindrome**: WAOOAW = Quality from any angle 🔄

### ✨ Key Features

**For Customers:**
- 🤖 **19+ Specialized Agents** across Marketing, Education, and Sales
- 🔍 **Smart Discovery** - Browse and filter agents by industry, skill, rating, and price
- 📊 **Real-Time Status** - See agent availability (Available, Working, Offline)
- 🎯 **Personalized Demos** - See agents work on YOUR business during trial
- 📦 **Keep All Work** - Deliverables are yours, subscribe or not
- 💬 **Live Activity Feed** - Watch agents working in real-time
- ⭐ **Proven Track Record** - Agent ratings, retention rates, response times

**For Platform Operators:**
- 🏛️ **Constitutional Governance** - Built-in ethics, approvals, and oversight
- 🔐 **Security First** - SYSTEM_AUDIT account, hash-chained logs, OPA policies
- 📈 **Scalable Infrastructure** - 13 microservices, autoscale to zero ($200-250/month)

## 💰 Business Model

### "Try Before Hire" - Zero Risk for Customers

**How it works:**
1. 🔍 **Browse** - Explore 19+ specialized agents across Marketing, Education, and Sales
2. 🎯 **Select** - Choose an agent that fits your needs
3. 🚀 **Trial** - 7-day free trial with real deliverables for your business
4. ✅ **Keep Work** - All deliverables are yours, whether you subscribe or not
5. 💳 **Subscribe** (Optional) - Continue with the agent if you love the results

**Why customers love it:**
- Try talent, keep results — no risk
- See real work, not just demos
- Cancel anytime — still keep what the agent delivered
- Platform absorbs trial cost (synthetic data, $5 cap per trial)

### 💵 Pricing

**For Customers:**
- **Single Agent**: ₹8,000-18,000/month (skill-dependent, industry specialization premium)
- **Team Package**: ₹19,000-30,000/month (Manager + 2-4 specialists, coordinated work)

**For Platform Operators:**
- **Infrastructure Cost**: $200-250/month (13 Cloud Run services, autoscale to zero)

---

## 🔑 Constitutional Principles

**Single Governor Invariant:**
- One Platform Governor session (you) approves external execution, emergency budgets, job pricing
- Vision Guardian has break-glass override authority (Governor ethics violations)

**Agent DNA (AMENDMENT-001):**
- **Specialization**: Agents are Jobs (specialized workforces), not generalized assistants
- **Skill Atomicity**: Skills are atomic units with Think→Act→Observe cycles
- **Runtime Note**: The current Plant runtime uses the Agent Construct model in `docs/PP/AGENT-CONSTRUCT-DESIGN.md`, with in-memory moulds, hired agents, skills, runs, and deliverables. Older Agent DNA/filesystem-memory language should be read as historical constitutional context, not literal runtime implementation.
- **Constitutional Embodiment**: Vector embeddings, semantic search, and governed reasoning remain active principles

**Ethics is Structural:**
- 4-level graduated escalation (auto-block, escalate to Vision Guardian, allow with disclaimer, log only)
- Mandatory gates (communication, execution) with trace link requirements
- Precedent seeds capture learning from Governor decisions (auto-approval with 24hr veto window)

**Circular Dependency Resolution:**
- Agent execution requires audit → Audit requires approval → Approval requires audit → **INFINITE LOOP**
- Solution: SYSTEM_AUDIT privileged account with governance exemption (Port 8010)
- Vision Guardian monitors SYSTEM_AUDIT behavior (deviation = constitutional crisis)
