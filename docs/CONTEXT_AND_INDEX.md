# WAOOAW — Context & Indexing Reference

**Version**: 2.10  
**Date**: 2026-04-17  
**Purpose**: Single-source operating manual for handing WAOOAW work to AI agents, especially zero-cost and small-context agents, so they can navigate, understand, plan, and execute complex platform tasks with minimal drift.  
**Update cadence**: Section 12 ("Latest Changes") should be refreshed daily.  
**Key design doc**: [`docs/PP/AGENT-CONSTRUCT-DESIGN.md`](PP/AGENT-CONSTRUCT-DESIGN.md) — full low-level design of the Agent Construct system (v2, 2179 lines). Read §§1–8 before touching `agent_mold/` or any construct pipeline.

## 0. How To Use This Document

Treat this file as the platform operating manual, not as a changelog dump. It should answer three questions fast: what WAOOAW is, where each responsibility lives, and which files are the canonical edit points for a task.

### Zero-cost agent handover contract

If you are handing work to a lower-cost or small-context agent, this document is the primary source of truth. The handoff should assume the agent can execute complex work only if task boundaries, file ownership, test expectations, and deployment rules are made explicit.

| Handover need | Where this document answers it | What the agent should do |
|---|---|---|
| Understand platform shape fast | §§1, 4, 5.1, 6 | Build a mental map before editing any code |
| Know exact edit surfaces | §5.2, §5.3, §13 | Restrict file reads and edits to the owning service paths |
| Avoid infra/config drift | §§8, 9, 14, 17, 19 | Externalize config, preserve image promotion, respect secrets flow |
| Execute complex tasks safely | §§11, 18, 19, 22 | Follow the planning, model-selection, testing, and troubleshooting rules in order |
| Recover when context is thin | §§17, 21, 22, 25 | Use the known gotchas, CLI playbooks, FAQ, and session recovery protocol before guessing |

**Operating rule:** when this document conflicts with stale comments, old plan files, or scattered notes, prefer this document unless a newer code change clearly proves otherwise.

### Reading order by task

| If you are doing... | Read first | Then read | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| First-time repo orientation | §1, §4, §5.1 | §13, §15, §16 | You understand product shape, service layout, ports, and start commands |
| CP or PP route bug | §5.2 | §13 CP/PP + Plant sections | You trace FE/BE/Gateway/Plant ownership without guessing |
| Plant runtime or hired-agent work | §4.6, §4.7 | §5.1, §13 Plant section | You use the correct Agent/Skill/Component/SkillRun vocabulary and files |
| Mobile work | §6, §23 | §13 mobile section, §15 | You know when mobile talks directly to Gateway vs through CP Backend |
| Docker, Terraform, deploy, or image-promotion work | §8, §8.1, §9 | §13 infra sections, §21 | You avoid baking environment logic into images or templates |
| Database, migration, or seed work | §10 | §13 Plant models/core sections | You know the DB entrypoints, migration path, and local/demo access pattern |
| Logging, tracing, or production debugging | §5.5, §9, §21, §22 | §13 Plant/Gateway/PP core sections | You start from the actual logging/metrics/observability files |

### Source-of-truth rules

| Content type | Canonical home in this document | What should stay out |
|---|---|---|
| Stable product and constitutional truths | §§1–4 | PR-by-PR storytelling |
| Current service ownership and runtime layout | §5 | Deep historical implementation notes |
| Deployment, Terraform, image promotion, secrets | §§8–9 | Environment-specific hacks or temporary overrides |
| Database, testing, ports, common commands | §§10–16 | Repeated command snippets copied into many other sections |
| Rapid code navigation | §13 | Narrative explanations better suited for architecture sections |
| Time-sensitive history | §12 | Permanent design guidance |

### Maintenance rules for keeping this document authoritative

| Rule | Why |
|---|---|
| Update the section that owns the truth instead of adding a new disconnected note | Prevents contradictions and duplicated guidance |
| Prefer stable entrypoints and central files over leaf implementation details | Makes the document usable for new engineers and small-context agents |
| Add temporary findings to §12 or §17, not to core architecture sections, unless the architecture actually changed | Keeps the bible durable instead of noisy |
| When a route or workflow changes, update both the ownership map and the file index in the same PR | Prevents navigation drift |
| If a concept has one canonical term, use it everywhere here even if code still carries a legacy name | Keeps public/runtime language converged |
| Bump version number (e.g. 2.9 → 2.10) and update `**Date**` whenever §17 or §12 is edited — or any structural section changes — in the same PR | Prevents stale version headers from misleading agents about document freshness |

## 1. Problem Statement & Vision

| Dimension | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Problem** | Businesses want to use AI agents but face high risk — they pay upfront with no proof of value, can't compare options, and have no governance guardrails. |
| **Market gap** | No marketplace exists where AI agents *earn* business by delivering real work before payment; all current solutions are SaaS-first, tool-first, not talent-first. |
| **Vision** | WAOOAW ("WAH-oo-ah", a palindrome = quality from any angle) is the first AI agent marketplace where specialized agents demonstrate value in a 7-day free trial. Customers keep all deliverables even if they cancel. |
| **Tagline** | "Agents Earn Your Business" |
| **Business model** | 7-day free trial → monthly subscription (₹8K–18K/month). Agents across Marketing, Education, Sales. |
| **Differentiator** | Constitutional governance (single Governor, L0/L1 compliance), agent personality/status, marketplace DNA (browse, compare, hire like Upwork — not a SaaS landing page). |

### 1.1 Platform Objective And Priority Ladder

WAOOAW exists to develop and rent value-generating agents to customers. The platform objective is not generic AI tooling or abstract workflow polish; it is to ship agents that are self-sufficient, autonomous, effective, efficient, and commercially useful in real customer environments.

| Priority | Objective | What success looks like |
|---|---|---|
| **P0** | Rent value-generating agents | Customers receive measurable business outcomes, not demo-only automation |
| **P1** | Digital Marketing Agent (DMA) is the first product priority | DMA creates customer-ready work that can be approved, scheduled, published, and improved from feedback |
| **P2** | YouTube-first DMA execution | YouTube content creation, approval, posting, scheduling, and performance review are strongest before broadening platform coverage |
| **P3** | Multi-platform DMA expansion | One theme becomes platform-native variants for LinkedIn, Facebook, X, Instagram, WhatsApp, and later channels |
| **P4** | Autonomous tuning loop | Outreach or posting performance feeds recommendations and improvements for the next content cycle |
| **P5** | Share Trader is the next major agent lane | Customer can connect exchange credentials, validate them, configure strategies, execute trades, review performance, and receive recommendations |

#### DMA scope that should dominate current prioritization

| Capability | Required outcome |
|---|---|
| Theme-to-content generation | One core theme can be transformed into platform-specific content, not duplicated copy |
| Approval workflow | Customer can review and approve content before release |
| Scheduling and posting | Customer can schedule approved content and trust the agent to post it correctly |
| Performance review | DMA can review post or outreach performance and feed that back into future suggestions or execution |
| Customer-value test | The work should feel like meaningful marketing output, not back-office UI polish detached from outcomes |

#### Share Trader scope after DMA

| Capability | Required outcome |
|---|---|
| Exchange connectivity | Customer can set up and verify exchange/API credentials |
| Strategy definition | Customer can define script, interval/frequency, and conditions such as RSI cutovers |
| Trade execution | Agent can execute approved trade flows against the configured exchange |
| Performance visibility | Customer can review executed trades and outcome history |
| Recommendations | Agent can recommend future trades based on runtime evidence |

#### Priority gate for planning and execution

| If a task is... | Default decision |
|---|---|
| Direct DMA value delivery | Prioritize first |
| Required enablement for DMA or Share Trader to run, deploy, promote, observe, or stay secure | Prioritize when it unblocks delivery |
| Generic polish without a path to agent value | Deprioritize |
| Architecture cleanup with no immediate product or runtime payoff | Reject or split down |

**Operating rule:** every plan, story, bug fix, infra change, and prompt update should explicitly name which objective above it advances. If it advances none of them, challenge the work before doing it.

## 2. Solution Hypothesis

> **If** we build a marketplace where AI agents deliver real, measurable work during a free trial with zero risk to the customer,  
> **and** every agent operates under constitutional governance with immutable audit trails,  
> **then** customers will convert at higher rates than traditional SaaS because they've already seen value,  
> **and** the platform will maintain trust through transparent, verifiable agent behavior.

### Key bets:

| Bet | Validation signal |
|-----|-------------------|
| Try-before-hire drives conversion | Trial-to-paid conversion rate > 30% |
| Constitutional governance builds trust | Zero policy violations in production |
| Marketplace UX beats SaaS landing pages | Higher engagement than feature-list pages |
| Single Governor model scales | One human can govern 19+ agents via automation |

---

## 3. Constitutional Design Pattern

WAOOAW uses a **two-layer constitutional framework** enforced at the data model level.

### L0 — Foundational Governance (applies to ALL entities)

| Code | Principle | Enforcement |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| L0-01 | Single Governor | `governance_agent_id` required on every entity |
| L0-02 | Amendment History | Append-only `amendment_history` JSON column |
| L0-03 | Immutable Audit | `hash_chain_sha256` links; no UPDATE to past |
| L0-04 | Supersession Chain | Entity evolution tracked via `evolution_markers` |
| L0-05 | Compliance Gate | `validate_self()` must pass before persistence |
| L0-06 | Version Control | Hash-based `version_hash` on every change |
| L0-07 | Signature Verification | RSA signature on amendments |

### L1 — Entity-Specific Rules

| Entity | Key rules |
|--------|-----------|
| Skill | Name + description required; category ∈ {technical, soft_skill, domain_expertise, certification} |
| JobRole | ≥1 required skill; seniority ∈ {junior, mid, senior} |
| Team | ≥1 agent; job_role_id set |
| Agent | skill_id + job_role_id + industry_id all required |
| Industry | Name required |

### Implementation files

| Purpose | File |
|---------|------|
| BaseEntity (7-section ORM) | `src/Plant/BackEnd/models/base_entity.py` |
| Constitutional validator | `src/Plant/BackEnd/validators/constitutional_validator.py` |
| Entity validator | `src/Plant/BackEnd/validators/entity_validator.py` |
| Hash chain | `src/Plant/BackEnd/security/hash_chain.py` |
| Cryptographic signatures | `src/Plant/BackEnd/security/cryptography.py` |
| Credential encryption | `src/Plant/BackEnd/security/credential_encryption.py` |

### BaseEntity 7 Sections

```
Section 1 — IDENTITY:                 id (UUID), entity_type, external_id
Section 2 — LIFECYCLE:                created_at, updated_at, deleted_at, status
Section 3 — VERSIONING:               version_hash, amendment_history, evolution_markers
Section 4 — CONSTITUTIONAL_ALIGNMENT: l0_compliance_status, amendment_alignment, drift_detector
Section 5 — AUDIT_TRAIL:              append_only, hash_chain_sha256, tamper_proof
Section 6 — METADATA:                 tags, custom_attributes, governance_notes
Section 7 — RELATIONSHIPS:            parent_id, child_ids, governance_agent_id
```

## 4. Four Major Components

> **Navigation note**: This section covers all four major components. The subsections appear in document order as 4.1, 4.2, 4.6, 4.7, 4.5, 4.3, 4.4 due to historical grouping. For clearest conceptual flow, read §4.3 (CP) and §4.4 (PP) before §4.6 (Agent Construct). The TOC above is alphabetically corrected and links directly to each subsection.

### 4.1 Plant (Core Agent Platform)

Full design: `docs/PP/AGENT-CONSTRUCT-DESIGN.md` |

### 4.2 Plant Gateway

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Role** | API gateway — auth, RBAC, policy, budget, audit middleware; proxies to Plant Backend |
| **Backend** | FastAPI on port 8000 (public-facing) |
| **Key paths** | `src/Plant/Gateway/` |
| **Entry point** | `src/Plant/Gateway/main.py` (787 lines) |
| **Middleware stack** | auth.py → rbac.py → policy.py → budget.py → audit.py → error_handler.py |
| **OPA policies** | `src/Plant/Gateway/opa/` — 5 Rego policy files + unit tests; OPA called over HTTPS from `rbac.py`, `policy.py`, `budget.py` middleware |
| **Infrastructure** | `src/Plant/Gateway/infrastructure/` — feature_flags/ |
| **Pattern** | Receives requests from CP/PP → validates JWT → queries OPA for RBAC/policy/budget decisions → proxies to Plant Backend at port 8001 |

### 4.6 Agent Construct Architecture

> **Full spec**: [`docs/PP/AGENT-CONSTRUCT-DESIGN.md`](PP/AGENT-CONSTRUCT-DESIGN.md) (v2, 2179 lines). This section is the quick-reference summary — read the full doc before editing any construct pipeline code.

#### Platform Hierarchy

```
Customer
  └── HiredAgent          (one runtime Agent hired by one customer)
    └── Skill         (smallest customer-visible value-producing capability)
      └── SkillRun (one execution record of one Skill)
        └── Deliverable / Approval outcome
```

**Canonical runtime rule:** external docs, route contracts, and new APIs should use `Agent`, `Skill`, `Component`, `SkillRun`, and `Goal` as the default runtime language.

**Legacy compatibility note:** the codebase still contains `GoalRun` and `flow_runs` storage names. Treat those as internal compatibility and persistence terms, not the preferred public vocabulary.

**Constructs** are internal building blocks. Customers never interact with them — only with the Skill API surface (configure → run → approve → receive deliverable).

**The mould is in-memory.** `AgentSpec` objects are created at process startup from `agent_mold/reference_agents.py` and held in `DimensionRegistry` + `SkillRegistry` in RAM. No DB persistence of the mould — only hired instances and runtime artefacts are persisted.

#### Construct Hierarchy

```
AgentSpec (blueprint — in-memory)
  ├── Dimensions          (Skill, Industry, Team, Integrations, Budget, Trial, UI, L10n)
  ├── ConstructBindings   (which Pump / Processor / Publisher / Connector to use)
  ├── ConstraintPolicy    (risk limits, rate limits, cost gates)
  └── LifecycleHooks      (on_hire, on_trial_end, on_cancel … — all defined, agents override)
        └── Skill
              ├── CONSTRUCT: Scheduler  ← PLATFORM CORE — when to run
              ├── CONSTRUCT: Pump       ← PLATFORM CORE — what data flows in
              ├── CONSTRUCT: Processor  ← AGENT-SPECIFIC — the AI brain
              ├── CONSTRUCT: Connector  ← PLATFORM CORE — credentials + protocol
              └── CONSTRUCT: Publisher  ← PLATFORM CORE — where results go out
```

#### Platform Core vs Agent-Specific

| Construct | Owner | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Scheduler | **Platform Core** | Cadence, retry, DLQ identical across all agents |
| Pump | **Platform Core** | Data assembly from DB + config is identical; schema only differs |
| Connector | **Platform Core** | Credential lifecycle, Secret Manager — never agent-specific |
| Publisher | **Platform Core** | Destination adapter registry is common |
| **Processor** | **Agent-Specific** | The AI reasoning, LLM calls, domain logic — only this varies |

**Invariant:** Constructs are stateless. State lives in the database. A construct reads from DB on entry, writes on exit.

### 4.7 Canonical Runtime Vocabulary

Use this vocabulary in plans, route reviews, API design, and code comments to prevent future drift.

| Term | Canonical meaning | Avoid drifting to |
|---|---|---|
| **Agent** | The customer-hired runtime worker that owns lifecycle state, schedule defaults, budget, payment linkage, and enabled Skills | Treating Agent as a single Skill or a one-off workflow |
| **Skill** | The smallest customer-visible, value-producing capability inside an Agent | Using generic `workflow` or `tool` for customer-facing capability |
| **Component** | A stateless execution unit inside a Skill | Stateful mini-agents or ad hoc plugin terminology |
| **Connector** | External integration boundary: credentials, auth, protocol, transport | Data-source synonym or publisher substitute |
| **Pump** | Reads or assembles input data for execution | Hidden business logic processor |
| **Processor** | Performs domain logic, AI reasoning, or transformation | Scheduler, connector, or publisher work |
| **Validator** | Evaluates quality, policy, constraints, and goal attainment | An invisible post-step buried inside Processor |
| **Publisher** | Writes, posts, or submits outputs to external systems | Generic connector or processor logic |
| **Platform Configuration** | PP-managed certified structure, bindings, limits, and governance fields | Customer-editable business inputs |
| **Customer Configuration** | Customer-managed runtime inputs within certified limits | PP-owned structural configuration |
| **Skill Run** | One execution record of one Skill, including run context, component history, status, approval state, outputs, and metrics | Publicly naming it a Flow when the business unit is a Skill |
| **Goal** | Expected business result measured at Skill or Agent level | Component-owned business outcome |

#### Anti-drift rules

| Rule | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| Prefer `SkillRun` in new public APIs and portal contracts | Keeps product language aligned with the customer-facing unit of value |
| Keep `flow_runs` and `GoalRun` as compatibility/storage names until a deliberate migration is approved | Avoids breaking persistence while converging public contracts |
| Every customer-facing business capability should fit `Agent -> Skill -> Component -> Skill Run -> Goal` | Makes architecture review and story planning consistent |
| Components remain stateless; state belongs in Agent, Skill configuration, SkillRun, and persisted records | Prevents hidden runtime state and easier debugging failures |

#### Key Agent Mold Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `agent_mold/spec.py` | `AgentSpec`, `CompiledAgentSpec`, `ConstructBindings`, `ConstraintPolicy`, `DimensionSpec`, `DimensionName` |
| `agent_mold/contracts.py` | `DimensionContract` ABC — `validate()` / `materialize()` / `register_hooks()` / `observe()` |
| `agent_mold/hooks.py` | `AgentLifecycleHooks` ABC — all platform lifecycle events (on_hire, on_trial_start, on_deliverable_approved, on_cancel …) |
| `agent_mold/enforcement.py` | `default_hook_bus()` singleton — builds the platform `HookBus` with platform-default hooks registered |
| `agent_mold/registry.py` | `DimensionRegistry`, `SkillRegistry` — startup wiring; `register("content.creator.v1", …)` |
| `agent_mold/reference_agents.py` | Marketing, tutor, trading reference `AgentSpec` definitions |
| `agent_mold/skills/content_creator.py` | `ContentCreatorProcessor` — generates `DailyThemeList` + `ContentPost` objects |
| `agent_mold/skills/trading_executor.py` | `TradingProcessor` — produces `TradingOrderIntent` in draft mode; never places real orders |
| `agent_mold/skills/publisher_engine.py` | `DestinationAdapter` ABC + `DestinationRegistry` + `PublisherEngine` |
| `agent_mold/skills/adapters_publish.py` | `SimulatedAdapter` (Phase 1 publisher) |
| `integrations/delta_exchange/` | Delta Exchange client, order placement, risk engine |
| `integrations/social/` | LinkedIn / social credential resolver |
| `services/content_analytics.py` | Content analytics — last-30-day performance insights for DMA content improvement recommendations (DMA-CONV-1 It3 #1050) |
| `api/v1/digital_marketing_activation.py` | DMA conversation loop — chat, required-fields gate, strategy workshop, theme generation, gated deliverable rule, auto-draft (DMA-CONV-1 + PR #1052) |

#### Construct Execution Flow (v2)

```
Scheduler → HookBus(PRE_PUMP) → Pump.pull() → HookBus(PRE_PROCESSOR)
  → Processor.execute() → HookBus(PRE_PUBLISH) → [ApprovalGate]
  → Connector.resolve() → Publisher.publish() → HookBus(POST_PUBLISH)
  → Deliverable persisted → LifecycleHook: on_goal_run_complete
```

#### ConstraintPolicy — mould-level guardrails

```python
class ConstraintPolicy(BaseModel):
    max_goal_runs_per_day:      Optional[int]   = None
    max_cost_per_run_usd:       Optional[float] = None
    max_position_size_usd:      Optional[float] = None   # trading
    max_concurrent_positions:   Optional[int]   = None   # trading
    allowed_exchanges:          List[str]       = []     # ["delta_exchange_india"]
    max_posts_per_day:          Optional[int]   = None   # content
    allowed_channels:           List[str]       = []     # ["linkedin", "instagram"]
    approval_required_before_publish: bool      = True
    max_cost_per_month_usd:     Optional[float] = None
    budget_alert_threshold_pct: float           = 0.8
```

#### HookBus stages

| Stage | Hook registered | Enforces |
|---|---|---|
| `PRE_PUMP` | `QuotaGateHook` | `quota_remaining > 0` |
| `PRE_PUMP` | `SchedulerPauseHook` | `scheduler_state.is_paused = false` |
| `PRE_PROCESSOR` | `ConstraintPolicyHook` | `max_goal_runs_per_day` not exceeded |
| `PRE_TOOL_USE` | `ApprovalRequiredHook` | External actions need approval_id |
| `PRE_PUBLISH` | `ApprovalGateHook` | `approval_mode != auto` requires approval |
| `POST_PUBLISH` | `CostAuditHook` | Log cost to metering service |

#### Agent profiles quick reference

| | Share Trader (`AGT-TRADING-001`) | Content Creator (`AGT-MKT-*`) |
|---|---|---|
| `processor_class` | `TradingProcessor` | `ContentCreatorProcessor` |
| `pump_class` | `TradingPump` (custom — live positions) | `GoalConfigPump` (platform default) |
| `publisher_class` | `DestinationPublisher` (→ `DeltaTradeAdapter`) | `DestinationPublisher` (→ `LinkedInAdapter`) |
| `max_goal_runs_per_day` | 10 | 3 |
| `approval_required` | Yes | Yes |
| Key hook override | `on_deliverable_approved` → place real order | `on_deliverable_approved` → trigger Publisher |
| DMA activation path | N/A | `digital_marketing_activation.py` — chat → required-fields gate → strategy workshop → derived themes → gated deliverable rule → content-calendar table → auto-draft creation. (DMA-CONV-1 #1046–#1052) |

### 4.5 Plant OPA (Policy Engine)

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Role** | Stateless Open Policy Agent service — evaluates RBAC, trial mode, governor role, agent budget, and sandbox routing policies |
| **Runtime** | Official OPA server (`openpolicyagent/opa:0.68.0`) on port 8181 |
| **Key paths** | `src/Plant/Gateway/opa/` |
| **Dockerfile** | `src/Plant/Gateway/opa/Dockerfile` — policies baked in at build time (code, not config) |
| **Policies** | `policies/rbac_pp.rego`, `policies/trial_mode.rego`, `policies/governor_role.rego`, `policies/agent_budget.rego`, `policies/sandbox_routing.rego` |
| **Tests** | `tests/` — 24 unit tests across 5 policy files; run via `opa test src/Plant/Gateway/opa -v` |
| **Access** | Service-to-service only (`allow_unauthenticated = false`); Plant Gateway authenticates using GCP Identity token |
| **Cloud Run** | `waooaw-plant-opa-{env}` — stateless, 0.5 CPU, 256 Mi, no DB, no VPC connector needed |
| **IAM** | `plant_gateway_sa` granted `roles/run.invoker` on the OPA service |
| **Two-gate design** | OPA is Gate 1 (role-level RBAC). Plant Backend `/api/v1/admin/db/*` is Gate 2 (hard admin-role check via `_require_admin_via_gateway`). Non-admin roles may pass Gate 1 for `resource="admin"` but are rejected at Gate 2. |

### 5.1 Platform Runtime Layout

| Layer | Primary responsibility | Entry files | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CP FrontEnd** | Customer UI, service selection, request shaping | `src/CP/FrontEnd/src/pages/`, `src/CP/FrontEnd/src/services/` | First place to inspect when the portal calls the wrong CP route |
| **CP BackEnd** | Thin proxy only: auth/registration local, runtime requests forwarded to Plant Gateway | `src/CP/BackEnd/main.py`, `src/CP/BackEnd/api/` | Must not own business logic or data storage |
| **Plant Gateway** | Public API ingress, JWT validation, RBAC, policy, budget, audit, proxy to Plant | `src/Plant/Gateway/main.py`, `src/Plant/Gateway/middleware/` | Customer-facing public routes live under `/api/v1/...` |
| **Plant BackEnd** | Runtime business logic, persistence, scheduling, approvals, hired-agent state, skill execution | `src/Plant/BackEnd/main.py`, `src/Plant/BackEnd/api/v1/`, `src/Plant/BackEnd/services/` | Source of truth for hired agents, skills, deliverables, approvals, and execution history |
| **PostgreSQL** | Durable system state | `src/Plant/BackEnd/models/`, Alembic migrations | Holds hired agents, skills, skill configs, deliverables, and current run backing tables |
| **Redis** | Caching, throttling, scheduler/support state | service-level integrations | Not the source of truth for runtime business records |
| **External systems** | OAuth, payments, exchanges, social publish targets | adapters and integrations | Should be reached via Connector/Publisher boundaries, not portal business logic |

### 5.2 Route Ownership And Debug Order

When a CP customer flow fails, trace it in this order so route drift is classified correctly.

| Step | Layer | Start here | What you are confirming |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | CP FrontEnd | `src/CP/FrontEnd/src/services/` | The frontend is calling the intended CP route |
| 2 | CP BackEnd | `src/CP/BackEnd/api/` | The thin proxy points to the canonical Plant path |
| 3 | Plant Gateway | mounted `/api/v1/...` route inventory | The public route is actually exposed |
| 4 | Plant BackEnd | `src/Plant/BackEnd/api/v1/` + `services/` | The handler implements the expected runtime semantics |
| 5 | Persistence | `models/` + live DB row shape | The identifiers and stored fields match the contract being probed |

#### Runtime route ownership map

| Customer capability | CP FrontEnd service | CP BackEnd proxy | Plant public route | Plant implementation file |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Hired-agent skills list | `src/CP/FrontEnd/src/services/agentSkills.service.ts` | `src/CP/BackEnd/api/cp_skills.py` | `GET /api/v1/hired-agents/{hired_instance_id}/skills` | `src/Plant/BackEnd/api/v1/agent_skills.py` |
| Save customer skill config | `src/CP/FrontEnd/src/services/agentSkills.service.ts` | `src/CP/BackEnd/api/cp_skills.py` | `PATCH /api/v1/hired-agents/{hired_instance_id}/skills/{skill_id}/customer-config` | `src/Plant/BackEnd/api/v1/skill_configs.py` |
| Skill run history | CP consumer of `/api/cp/flow-runs` | `src/CP/BackEnd/api/cp_flow_runs.py` | `GET /api/v1/skill-runs`, `GET /api/v1/skill-runs/{skill_run_id}` | `src/Plant/BackEnd/api/v1/flow_runs.py` |
| Component run history | CP consumer of `/api/cp/component-runs` | `src/CP/BackEnd/api/cp_flow_runs.py` | `GET /api/v1/component-runs?flow_run_id=...` | `src/Plant/BackEnd/api/v1/flow_runs.py` |
| Approval queue | CP approvals panel | `src/CP/BackEnd/api/cp_approvals_proxy.py` | `GET /api/v1/hired-agents/{hired_agent_id}/deliverables?...` | `src/Plant/BackEnd/api/v1/deliverables_simple.py` |
| Approve/reject deliverable | CP approvals panel | `src/CP/BackEnd/api/cp_approvals_proxy.py` | `POST /api/v1/deliverables/{deliverable_id}/review` | `src/Plant/BackEnd/api/v1/deliverables_simple.py` |

### 5.3 Service Ownership Map

Use this table when deciding where a change belongs before you open any file.

| Domain | Primary responsibility | Edit here first | Route/API entrypoint | Test home |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CP FrontEnd | Customer-facing web UX and request shaping | `src/CP/FrontEnd/src/pages/`, `src/CP/FrontEnd/src/services/` | Browser calls `/api/cp/...` or Gateway-backed endpoints | `src/CP/FrontEnd/src/__tests__/`, `src/CP/FrontEnd/e2e/` |
| CP BackEnd | Thin proxy and customer-auth support flows | `src/CP/BackEnd/api/`, `src/CP/BackEnd/services/plant_gateway_client.py` | `/api/cp/...` | `src/CP/BackEnd/tests/` |
| PP FrontEnd | Internal operator UX, governor/admin tools | `src/PP/FrontEnd/src/pages/`, `src/PP/FrontEnd/src/components/` | Browser calls `/pp/...` or PP proxy routes | `src/PP/FrontEnd/src/` tests |
| PP BackEnd | Operator thin proxy, admin workflows, observability hooks | `src/PP/BackEnd/api/`, `src/PP/BackEnd/clients/plant_client.py` | `/pp/...` | `src/PP/BackEnd/tests/` |
| Plant Gateway | Auth, RBAC, policy, audit, public ingress | `src/Plant/Gateway/main.py`, `src/Plant/Gateway/middleware/` | `/api/v1/...` public surface | `src/Plant/Gateway/tests/`, root `tests/` |
| Plant BackEnd | Runtime business logic, persistence, scheduling, approvals | `src/Plant/BackEnd/api/v1/`, `src/Plant/BackEnd/services/`, `src/Plant/BackEnd/models/` | Handlers behind Gateway `/api/v1/...` | `src/Plant/BackEnd/tests/` |
| Mobile | Customer mobile UX, direct Gateway consumption, device integrations | `src/mobile/src/` | Mostly Plant Gateway `/api/v1/...`, not CP BackEnd, unless a CP-only capability is required | `src/mobile/__tests__/`, `src/mobile/e2e/` |
| Terraform/Cloud Run | Environment wiring, service deployment, secrets injection, scaling | `cloud/terraform/`, `.github/workflows/waooaw-deploy.yml` | Cloud Run services + LB | Manual validation + targeted infra tests |

### 5.4 Ops, Infra, And Deployment Control Plane

These are the canonical files for delivery, environments, and operational behavior. If a task touches deployment or runtime wiring, start here before making service-level edits.

| Concern | Primary source files | Why these files matter | Edit rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| Local full-stack startup | `docker-compose.local.yml`, `start-local-no-docker.sh` | Defines local service topology and fallback non-Docker startup | Keep Docker as the default development path |
| Regression test topology | `docker-compose.test.yml`, `tests/` | Defines isolated test containers and cross-service checks | Never replace with venv-only commands |
| Mobile local/dev flow | `src/mobile/CODESPACE_DEV.md`, `src/mobile/start-codespace.sh`, `src/mobile/Dockerfile.test` | Owns mobile dev/test startup and Codespace behavior | Keep mobile instructions aligned with actual Expo/EAS files |
| CI validation | `.github/workflows/waooaw-ci.yml`, `.github/workflows/cp-pipeline.yml` | Gate lint, tests, and branch quality | CI edits must preserve Docker-first validation |
| Deploy + image promotion | `.github/workflows/waooaw-deploy.yml`, `cloud/terraform/`, §8.1 | Owns build once, promote unchanged flow | Never bake env-specific values into image or Dockerfile |
| Environment tfvars and scaling | `cloud/terraform/environments/`, `cloud/terraform/variables.tf` | Own safe defaults and per-env overrides | Defaults in `variables.tf`, overrides in tfvars |
| Service stacks | `cloud/terraform/stacks/` | Service-specific Cloud Run, secrets, env vars, IAM wiring | Avoid duplicating logic already present in modules/root |
| Monitoring assets | `infrastructure/monitoring/`, `cloud/monitoring/` | Prometheus, Grafana, alert rules, dashboards | Keep monitoring changes traceable to a service need |
| Supplemental Docker/K8s assets | `infrastructure/docker/`, `infrastructure/kubernetes/` | Secondary deployment/support assets outside the Cloud Run path | Treat as infra support, not the primary promotion path |

### 5.5 Logging, Metrics, And Debugging Spine

Start with these files when the problem is observability, production diagnosis, or request tracing.

| Capability | Primary files | What they own |
|---|---|---|
| Plant structured logging + PII masking | `src/Plant/BackEnd/core/logging.py` | Global logger setup and `PIIMaskingFilter` |
| Plant metrics and observability wiring | `src/Plant/BackEnd/core/metrics.py`, `src/Plant/BackEnd/core/observability.py` | Metrics export and observability bootstrap |
| Gateway operational middleware | `src/Plant/Gateway/middleware/audit.py`, `src/Plant/Gateway/middleware/error_handler.py`, `src/Plant/Gateway/middleware/circuit_breaker.py` | Audit trail, RFC 7807 errors, upstream protection |
| CP request correlation and audit | `src/CP/BackEnd/core/dependencies.py`, `src/CP/BackEnd/services/audit_dependency.py`, `src/CP/BackEnd/services/plant_gateway_client.py` | Correlation IDs, audit emission, gateway client resilience |
| PP tracing and metrics | `src/PP/BackEnd/core/observability.py`, `src/PP/BackEnd/core/metrics.py`, `src/PP/BackEnd/services/audit_dependency.py` | OTel spans, Prometheus metrics, PP audit integration |
| Infra monitoring and dashboards | `infrastructure/monitoring/`, `cloud/monitoring/` | Alert rules, dashboards, Prometheus/Grafana assets |
| Cloud Run / GCP diagnosis | §9, §21, §22 | Logs, service-account access, and standard recovery commands |

### Technology stack

## 5.6 Platform NFR Standards — Mandatory Patterns for Every New Route

> **Active source of truth in this branch**: this section plus the live routing/dependency implementations in `src/CP/BackEnd/core/`, `src/Plant/BackEnd/core/`, and `src/PP/BackEnd/core/`.  
> Older iteration-plan references were removed during doc cleanup; keep the next agent on the live source files above.

### What is implemented

All NFR corrective (C1–C7) and preventive (P1–P4) gaps are closed. PP Backend baseline (P5) is also closed. C8 (PII field-level DB encryption) is **permanently parked** — see rationale below.

> Historical note: this work was completed in the NFR sprint of 2026-02-27. PR history is in §12 if needed.

### Mandatory: `waooaw_router()` — never bare `APIRouter()`

Every `api/` file in CP, Plant, and PP **must** use `waooaw_router()` instead of bare `APIRouter()`. Bare `APIRouter()` in `api/` directories is banned by `ruff` (TID251) in each service's `pyproject.toml` — it will fail CI.

```python
# ❌ FORBIDDEN in api/ directories
from fastapi import APIRouter
router = APIRouter(prefix="/agents", tags=["agents"])

# ✅ CORRECT
from core.routing import waooaw_router
router = waooaw_router(prefix="/agents", tags=["agents"])
```

`waooaw_router()` automatically injects `Depends(require_correlation_id)` on every route. Future platform-wide gates added to `core/routing.py` apply to every route with zero per-file changes.

| Service | Router factory file | Dependencies file |
|---------|--------------------|-----------------|
| CP BackEnd | `src/CP/BackEnd/core/routing.py` | `src/CP/BackEnd/core/dependencies.py` |
| Plant BackEnd | `src/Plant/BackEnd/core/routing.py` | `src/Plant/BackEnd/core/dependencies.py` |
| Plant Gateway | — (middleware-based) | `src/Plant/Gateway/core/dependencies.py` |
| PP BackEnd | `src/PP/BackEnd/core/routing.py` | `src/PP/BackEnd/core/dependencies.py` |

### Mandatory: Global `dependencies=[]` on FastAPI app

All four `FastAPI(...)` app instantiations have `dependencies=[Depends(require_correlation_id)]` wired at the app level. This runs on every request. Do not remove it.

### Mandatory: Correlation ID

`require_correlation_id` reads `X-Correlation-ID` from the incoming request (or generates a UUID4 if absent) and stores it in a `ContextVar`. All log records and outbound calls must carry the same ID.

```python
# Read the current correlation ID anywhere in a request lifecycle:
from core.dependencies import _correlation_id
cid = _correlation_id.get()  # returns str — never empty during a request
```

### Mandatory: Audit logging pattern (CP, PP)

Use `get_audit_logger` FastAPI dependency. Never call `AuditClient` directly from a route — always go through the dependency. All calls are fire-and-forget (never blocks response).

```python
from services.audit_dependency import AuditLogger, get_audit_logger

@router.post("/my-endpoint")
async def my_endpoint(
    body: MyRequest,
    audit: AuditLogger = Depends(get_audit_logger),  # add this
):
    result = await do_work(body)
    await audit.log("screen_name", "action_name", "success", user_id=..., email=...)
    return result
```

| Service | Audit dependency file |
|---------|---------------------|
| CP BackEnd | `src/CP/BackEnd/services/audit_dependency.py` |
| PP BackEnd | `src/PP/BackEnd/services/audit_dependency.py` |

### Mandatory: Read replica for read-only routes

Any endpoint that only reads data **must** use `get_read_db_session()`. Only write endpoints (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) use `get_db_session()`.

```python
# ❌ WRONG — hits primary for a read-only list
@router.get("/agents")
async def list_agents(db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db_session)):
    ...

# ✅ CORRECT
@router.get("/agents")
async def list_agents(db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_read_db_session)):
    ...
```

### Mandatory: Circuit breaker on all upstream HTTP clients

All `httpx` calls to upstream services must go through a circuit breaker. The pattern:
- Class-level `CircuitBreaker` instance (shared across all requests, not per-request)
- 3 failures → OPEN; 30s recovery → HALF_OPEN; 1 success → CLOSED
- `ServiceUnavailableError` on OPEN → HTTP 503

| Client | Location | CB implemented? |
|--------|----------|:--------------:|
| CP `PlantGatewayClient` | `src/CP/BackEnd/services/plant_gateway_client.py` | ✅ |
| CP `PlantClient` | `src/CP/BackEnd/services/plant_client.py` | ✅ |
| PP `PlantAPIClient` | `src/PP/BackEnd/clients/plant_client.py` | ✅ (PP-N1) |
| Plant Gateway middleware | `src/Plant/Gateway/middleware/circuit_breaker.py` | ✅ (shared CB) |

### Mandatory: Feature flag dependency (do not route-check flags inline)

```python
# src/CP/BackEnd/api/feature_flag_dependency.py
# src/Plant/BackEnd/api/v1/feature_flag_dependency.py

from api.feature_flag_dependency import require_flag  # CP path

@router.post("/new-hire-wizard")
async def hire(
    _: bool = Depends(require_flag("new_hire_wizard")),  # 404 if flag off
):
    ...
```

### PII masking in logs — already active

`PIIMaskingFilter` is wired at the root logger in both CP and Plant backends. Emails appear as `j***@domain.com`, phones as `+91******4567`, IPs as `1.2.3.XXX`. Route code does not need to do anything — masking is automatic.

Debug tip: trace by `user_id` or `X-Correlation-ID` (never by email in logs — masked). DB still has plaintext email for lookups.

### C8 — PII field-level DB encryption: PERMANENTLY PARKED

**Decision**: Application-layer encrypt-on-write for `email`/`phone`/`full_name` is deferred indefinitely.

**Rationale**:
- Cloud SQL CMEK covers the disk/backup threat model (the only threat that field encryption would add protection against)
- PII masking in logs removes the Cloud Logging exposure risk
- `email_hash` index allows blind lookups without plaintext scanning
- GDPR erasure wipes all PII columns on demand
- Field encryption would break `WHERE email = ?` queries, admin tooling, and make incident debugging significantly harder

**Do not implement C8.** If a compliance audit specifically requires application-layer field encryption, re-open the discussion with the engineering team.

## 6. Service Communication & Data Flow

### Request flow (CP example)

```
User browser → CP Frontend (React)
  → CP Backend (FastAPI :8020)
    → Plant Gateway (FastAPI :8000)  [JWT validation, RBAC, policy, budget check]
      → Plant OPA (:8181)  [rbac_pp / trial_mode / governor_role / agent_budget / sandbox_routing]
      → Plant Backend (FastAPI :8001) [business logic, DB access]
        → PostgreSQL / Redis / External APIs
```

### CP Gateway → Plant Route Architecture (Construct-facing)

```
Customer App (mobile)
        │  JWT
        ▼
CP BackEnd ──── PlantGatewayClient ────► Plant Gateway
                                                │
                              ┌─────────────────┤
                              │  OPA checks:    │
                              │  trial_mode     │ → caps tasks_used ≤ 10
                              │  governor_role  │ → 5 sensitive actions need approval token
                              │  sandbox_routing│ → trial hires → Plant sandbox
                              └─────────────────┤
                                                │
                                                ▼
                                      Plant BackEnd
```

**Governor-gated CP routes** (require an approval token from `POST /pp/approvals`):

| CP Route | Governor reason |
|---|---|
| `POST /cp/trading/approve-execute` | Financial action — irreversible |
| `POST /cp/hired-agents/{id}/platform-connections` | OAuth credential storage |
| `DELETE /cp/hired-agents/{id}/platform-connections/{conn_id}` | Credential removal |
| `POST /cp/hire/wizard/finalize` | Subscription commitment |
| `PATCH /cp/hired-agents/{id}/skills/{skill_id}/goal-config` | Goal override in production |

### Key communication patterns

| Pattern | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| CP/PP → Gateway | HTTP proxy; CP/PP backends forward requests using `httpx` to `PLANT_GATEWAY_URL` |
| Gateway → Plant | HTTP proxy with identity token (GCP metadata server in Cloud Run, shared JWT in dev) |
| Gateway middleware order | Error handler → Auth → RBAC → Policy → Budget → Audit → Proxy |
| Gateway → OPA | `rbac.py`, `policy.py`, `budget.py` each make a `POST /v1/data/gateway/<policy>/allow` HTTP call to `OPA_URL`. OPA returns `{"result": {"allow": bool, ...}}`. Circuit breaker wraps every call. |
| Auth flow | Google OAuth2 → JWT issued by CP/PP → CP FrontEnd keeps access token in memory and restores via `POST /auth/refresh` using the httpOnly refresh cookie → Gateway validates and forwards to Plant |
| Connected-platform OAuth callbacks | Full-page redirects for external platform connections should complete on a public callback surface, restore session there, then resume the protected wizard. Protected routes alone are not safe callback targets when CP web auth is memory-only. |
| Registration flow (web/CP) | CP Backend `/api/register` → creates customer in local DB → calls Plant Gateway `/api/v1/customers` to create in Plant DB |
| Registration flow (mobile) | Mobile app → Plant Gateway **directly** (no CP Backend). Three steps: `POST /auth/register` (upsert customer) → `POST /auth/otp/start` (issue OTP challenge) → `POST /auth/otp/verify` (verify code, receive JWT). All three paths are in `PUBLIC_ENDPOINTS` — no prior JWT needed. ⚠️ As of 2026-04-17, `/auth/register`, `/auth/otp/start`, and `/auth/otp/verify` are **not yet deployed on demo**; `smoke-mobile-routes.sh` uses `probe_tracked()` (informational, non-blocking) for these paths. See §17 for the `probe_tracked()` vs `probe()` distinction. |
| CP registration key | Shared secret (`CP_REGISTRATION_KEY`) used between CP → Gateway to authorize customer upsert calls |

### Database ownership

- **Plant Backend** owns the single PostgreSQL database (`waooaw_db`)
- CP Backend has its own `user` table for auth (SQLite-like local or PostgreSQL)
- PP Backend proxies all data operations to Plant via Gateway
- All entity tables inherit from `BaseEntity` (7-section schema)

## 8. Deployment Pipeline

### GCP deployment flow (`waooaw-deploy.yml`)

```
1. Resolve image tag (SHA-short + run number)
2. Detect which components have Dockerfiles
3. Build Docker images (parallel: CP-BE, CP-FE, PP-BE, PP-FE, Plant-BE, Plant-GW, Plant-OPA)
4. Push to Artifact Registry (asia-south1-docker.pkg.dev/waooaw-oauth/waooaw/)
5. Terraform plan (per environment)
6. Terraform apply (creates/updates Cloud Run services + LB)
```

### Component → Docker image mapping

| Component | Dockerfile | Image name |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| CP Backend | `src/CP/BackEnd/Dockerfile` | `cp-backend` |
| CP Frontend | `src/CP/FrontEnd/Dockerfile` | `cp` |
| PP Backend | `src/PP/BackEnd/Dockerfile` | `pp-backend` |
| PP Frontend | `src/PP/FrontEnd/Dockerfile` | `pp` |
| Plant Backend | `src/Plant/BackEnd/Dockerfile` | `plant-backend` |
| Plant Gateway | `src/Plant/Gateway/Dockerfile` | `plant-gateway` |
| Plant OPA | `src/Plant/Gateway/opa/Dockerfile` | `plant-opa` |
| CP Combined | `src/CP/Dockerfile.combined` | (BE+FE in one) |
| PP Combined | `src/PP/Dockerfile.combined` | (BE+FE in one) |
| Mobile | N/A — distributed via EAS Build / Play Store | N/A — see §23 for EAS build profiles (`development`, `demo`, `uat`, `prod`) |

### Environments

| Environment | Domain (CP) | Domain (PP) | Scaling |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| demo | cp.demo.waooaw.com | pp.demo.waooaw.com | min 0, max 2 (scale to zero) |
| uat | cp.uat.waooaw.com | pp.uat.waooaw.com | min 0, max 3 |
| prod | cp.waooaw.com | pp.waooaw.com | min 1, max 10 |

### 8.1 — Image Promotion & Secrets Mandate ⚠️ MANDATORY FOR ALL AGENTS

> **Read this before touching any Dockerfile, terraform file, Python config, or environment variable.**

**Rule**: ONE Docker image is built once and promoted **unchanged** through `demo → uat → prod`. The same binary runs in every environment. Environment-specific behaviour is controlled **entirely** by externally injected values — never by logic baked in at build time.

#### Where each type of value belongs

| Value type | Where it lives | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Sensitive credentials | **GCP Secret Manager** — `secrets {}` block in Cloud Run terraform | `JWT_SECRET`, `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID`, `CP_REGISTRATION_KEY`, SMTP username/password |
| Non-sensitive env-specific flags | **`environments/{env}.tfvars`** → wired as `env_vars` in `main.tf` | `PAYMENTS_MODE`, `OTP_DELIVERY_MODE`, `ENVIRONMENT`, `PLANT_GATEWAY_URL` |
| Python/JS code defaults | **`variables.tf` `default =`** for the fallback when a tfvar is omitted | `default = "razorpay"`, `default = "provider"` |
| Docker image contents | **Never** anything environment-specific | ❌ No env names, no URLs, no secrets, no feature flags |

#### Terraform template rules (violations will be reverted)

```hcl
# ✅ CORRECT — clean passthrough, no logic baked in
env_vars = {
  PAYMENTS_MODE   = var.payments_mode        # value comes from tfvars
  OTP_DELIVERY_MODE = var.otp_delivery_mode  # value comes from tfvars
}

# ❌ WRONG — baking environment-conditional logic into the template
env_vars = {
  PAYMENTS_MODE     = var.payments_mode != "" ? var.payments_mode : "razorpay"  # ternary = baked logic
  OTP_DELIVERY_MODE = var.mode != "" ? var.mode : (var.environment == "demo" ? "disabled" : "provider")  # worst case: env name in template
}
```

Defaults belong in `variables.tf` (`default = "razorpay"`), not in `main.tf` ternary expressions. The template must be brainless — it only passes `var.*` through.

#### Checklist before opening a PR that touches terraform or config

- [ ] No hardcoded `"demo"`, `"uat"`, `"prod"` strings in `main.tf` env_vars block
- [ ] No ternary expressions whose fallback encodes an environment name or a sensitive value
- [ ] All secrets are in `secrets {}` block (sourced from Secret Manager), not `env_vars {}`
- [ ] Every new env var has a corresponding `variable` entry in `variables.tf` with a safe `default`
- [ ] Every `environments/{env}.tfvars` explicitly sets the new variable (no silent reliance on `default`)
- [ ] The same image tag can be deployed to all three environments by changing only tfvars

## 9. GCP, Secrets & Terraform

### GCP project

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Project ID | `waooaw-oauth` |
| Region | `asia-south1` (Mumbai) |
| Artifact Registry | `asia-south1-docker.pkg.dev/waooaw-oauth/waooaw/` |
| Static IP | `waooaw-lb-ip` (shared across environments) |

### GCP services used

- **Cloud Run** — 7 services (CP-BE, CP-FE, PP-BE, PP-FE, Plant-BE, Plant-GW, **Plant-OPA** `waooaw-plant-opa-{env}`)
- **Cloud SQL** — PostgreSQL 15 (connected via Cloud SQL Proxy / unix socket)
- **Cloud Load Balancer** — single IP, multi-domain routing (cp.*.waooaw.com, pp.*.waooaw.com)
- **Artifact Registry** — Docker image storage
- **Secret Manager** — GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET, JWT_SECRET, CP_REGISTRATION_KEY, TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY, etc.
- **VPC Connector** — private networking for Cloud Run → Cloud SQL
- **SSL managed certificates** — for custom domains

### Terraform structure

```

### Single IP + Load Balancer architecture

```
Static IP (waooaw-lb-ip)
  → Global HTTPS Load Balancer
    → URL Map (host-based routing):
        cp.demo.waooaw.com  → CP Frontend NEG (Cloud Run)
        pp.demo.waooaw.com  → PP Frontend NEG (Cloud Run)
        /api/*              → Backend NEGs
    → SSL Certificate (managed)
```

### Codespace Service Account — `waooaw-codespace-reader`

> **AI agents in Codespace have permanent GCP access via this SA.** `gcloud auth list` should show it ACTIVE. If not, re-run `bash .devcontainer/gcp-auth.sh`.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| SA email | `waooaw-codespace-reader@waooaw-oauth.iam.gserviceaccount.com` |
| Key stored as | Codespace secret `GCP_SA_KEY` (personal, repo-scoped to `dlai-sd/WAOOAW`) |
| Key persisted at | `/root/.gcp/waooaw-sa.json` (written by `gcp-auth.sh` on boot) |
| Auto-activation | `.devcontainer/gcp-auth.sh` runs as `postCreateCommand` on every Codespace start |

#### SA granted roles

| Role | What it enables |
|------|-----------------|
| `roles/logging.viewer` | Read Cloud Logging — pull service logs for any log command |
| `roles/secretmanager.viewer` | List secrets in Secret Manager |
| `roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor` | **Read secret values** — `DB_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, etc. |
| `roles/run.viewer` | Describe Cloud Run services, revisions, traffic |
| `roles/cloudsql.viewer` | List and describe Cloud SQL instances |
| `roles/cloudsql.client` | Connect to Cloud SQL via Cloud SQL Auth Proxy |
| `roles/cloudsql.admin` | Patch Cloud SQL instance settings (e.g. enable/disable public IP) |

#### Cloud SQL Proxy — permanent DB tunnel

- **Binary**: `/usr/local/bin/cloud-sql-proxy` (v2.14.2, auto-downloaded by `gcp-auth.sh` if missing)
- **Instance**: defaults to `waooaw-oauth:asia-south1:plant-sql-demo`; override with `WAOOAW_CLOUDSQL_ENV=uat|prod` or explicit `WAOOAW_CLOUDSQL_INSTANCE_NAME`
- **Port**: `127.0.0.1:15432` by default; override with `WAOOAW_CLOUDSQL_PROXY_PORT`
- **Auth**: `--credentials-file=/root/.gcp/waooaw-sa.json` (written by `gcp-auth.sh` from Codespaces secret `GCP_SA_KEY`)
- **Starts automatically** via `gcp-auth.sh` on Codespace boot, but for any DB work the safe path is to re-run the script once in the current shell
- **Log**: `/tmp/cloud-sql-proxy.log`
- **pgpass**: `/root/.pgpass` — enables passwordless `psql` (written by `gcp-auth.sh` from `${WAOOAW_CLOUDSQL_ENV}-plant-database-url` unless overridden)
- **DB env file**: `/root/.env.db` — exports host/port/user/db only; passwordless `psql` works because `gcp-auth.sh` also writes `/root/.pgpass`

#### Codespaces build assets — mandatory path for review builds

For Codespaces build, restart, and review URL publishing, use the repo's existing assets together. Do not invent ad-hoc `docker build`, `docker run`, hand-written compose stacks, or guessed `app.github.dev` URLs.

| Asset | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.devcontainer/gcp-auth.sh` | Activates the service account, starts Cloud SQL Auth Proxy on `15432`, writes `/root/.pgpass`, writes `/root/.env.db` |
| `.codespace/demo.env` | Docker-consumable env file for the Codespaces demo stack |
| `docker-compose.local.yml` | Base WAOOAW local service definitions |
| `docker-compose.codespace.yml` | Codespaces overlay: Cloud SQL proxy path, forwarded ports, host-gateway wiring |
| `scripts/codespace-stack.sh` | Supported wrapper for `build`, `up`, `restart`, `down`, `status`, `doctor`, and `urls` |

**Required pre-build cleanup rule:** before any new Codespaces build, remove stale WAOOAW-local images so Compose does not silently reuse old layers or superseded service images.

**First-attempt Codespaces build path:**
```bash
# 1. Restore GCP auth + Cloud SQL proxy
bash /workspaces/WAOOAW/.devcontainer/gcp-auth.sh

# 2. Remove stale WAOOAW-local containers/images from prior runs
bash /workspaces/WAOOAW/scripts/codespace-stack.sh clean
docker image prune -f

# 3. Rebuild and start using the repo's existing Codespaces assets
bash /workspaces/WAOOAW/scripts/codespace-stack.sh up cp

# 4. Publish the real review URLs from the repo wrapper
bash /workspaces/WAOOAW/scripts/codespace-stack.sh urls
```

**Execution rule:** if a Codespaces review build behaves differently from the repo guidance, first prove these four facts before debugging application code:

1. `bash /workspaces/WAOOAW/.devcontainer/gcp-auth.sh` succeeded.
2. `.codespace/demo.env` exists and is the env source for Compose.
3. The stack was started through `scripts/codespace-stack.sh`, not manual Docker commands.
4. The review URL being shared came from `scripts/codespace-stack.sh urls` and matches `https://${CODESPACE_NAME}-{PORT}.${GITHUB_CODESPACES_PORT_FORWARDING_DOMAIN}/`.

**Maintenance rule:** if a new Codespaces build is required, repeat the cleanup before the rebuild. If the stack still misbehaves after cleanup, run `bash /workspaces/WAOOAW/scripts/codespace-stack.sh doctor` before changing application code.

**First-attempt path:**
```bash
# 0. Preconditions — verify these before spending time debugging
which gcloud
printenv GCP_SA_KEY >/dev/null && echo "GCP_SA_KEY present"

# 1. Choose target environment (default is demo if unset)
export WAOOAW_CLOUDSQL_ENV=demo

# Examples:
# export WAOOAW_CLOUDSQL_ENV=uat
# export WAOOAW_CLOUDSQL_ENV=prod

# 2. Run the auth/bootstrap script once per Codespace shell when you need DB access
bash /workspaces/WAOOAW/.devcontainer/gcp-auth.sh

# 3. Confirm success before querying
gcloud auth list
test -f /root/.env.db && echo ".env.db ready"
pgrep -fa cloud-sql-proxy

# 4. Connect
source /root/.env.db && psql -c "SELECT current_database(), current_user;"

# 5. Optional direct form if you need to avoid sourcing shell state
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 15432 -U plant_app plant -c "SELECT version_num FROM alembic_version;"
```

> **Public IP**: the selected `plant-sql-<env>` instance must have public IP enabled for this Codespaces Auth Proxy path.
> If the proxy log ever shows `instance does not have IP of type "PUBLIC"` (e.g. after a Terraform refresh),
> re-run: `gcloud sql instances patch plant-sql-${WAOOAW_CLOUDSQL_ENV:-demo} --assign-ip --project=waooaw-oauth`, wait ~30s, then restart the auth script.

### Secrets in GitHub

- Stored as GitHub repository secrets
- Used in workflows via `${{ secrets.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID }}` etc.
- Key secrets: `GCP_SA_KEY` (service account JSON), `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `JWT_SECRET`, `CP_REGISTRATION_KEY`, `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY`

### Secrets in GCP

- Stored in GCP Secret Manager
- Referenced in Terraform as `secrets = { KEY = "SECRET_NAME:latest" }`
- Cloud Run services access them as environment variables
- Script to set: `scripts/set_gcp_secrets_cp_turnstile.sh`

## 10. Database — Local, Demo, UAT, Prod

### Connection strings by environment

| Environment | Connection | Driver |
|-------------|-----------|--------|
| Local regression stack only | `postgresql+asyncpg://waooaw:waooaw_dev_password@postgres:5432/waooaw_db` | asyncpg |
| Local host fallback only | `postgresql+asyncpg://waooaw:waooaw_dev_password@localhost:5432/waooaw_db` | asyncpg |
| Demo/UAT/Prod and all persistence work | Cloud SQL via Auth Proxy / unix socket / private IP (set via `DATABASE_URL` env) | asyncpg |

### Key database files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/Plant/BackEnd/core/database.py` | Global async DB connector (engine, sessions, pooling) |
| `src/Plant/BackEnd/core/config.py` | Settings with DB URL validation |
| `src/Plant/BackEnd/database/init_db.py` | Table creation script |
| `src/Plant/BackEnd/database/seed_data.py` | Seed data loader |
| `src/Plant/BackEnd/database/seeds/` | Seed definitions (agent types) |
| `src/Plant/BackEnd/database/migrations/` | Alembic migrations — latest applied to demo: `040_dma_batch_type_workflow.py` (PR #1065, adds `batch_type` ENUM + `parent_batch_id` FK on `marketing_draft_batches` — applied 2026-04-15). Also: `039_credential_ref_and_secret_manager_ref.py` (PR #1061, `credential_ref` + `secret_manager_ref` on posts), `038_add_brand_voices.py` (DMA-CONV-1 It2 #1048, `brand_voices` table), `037_dma_media_artifact_persistence.py` (media artifact columns on draft posts) |
| `src/Plant/BackEnd/alembic.ini` | Alembic config |
| `src/Plant/BackEnd/create_tables.py` | Direct table creation |
| `src/Plant/BackEnd/Dockerfile.migrations` | Migration runner Docker image |
| `infrastructure/database/` | DB infrastructure (migration SQL, tests) |
| `docker-compose.local.yml` | Local Postgres + pgvector container |

### How to connect to Plant Cloud SQL from Codespace

Agent rule: schema changes, persisted-behavior stories, and DB smoke validation should use the intended Cloud SQL environment through the Auth Proxy. Demo remains the default and the normal proving ground before UAT/prod; the Docker Postgres containers are only for isolated regression tests and must not be treated as the persistence source of truth.

Agent rule for Codespaces review builds: the supported build/publish path is `.devcontainer/gcp-auth.sh` + `.codespace/demo.env` + `docker-compose.local.yml` + `docker-compose.codespace.yml` orchestrated through `scripts/codespace-stack.sh`. Before any fresh build, clear stale WAOOAW-local Docker images with `bash /workspaces/WAOOAW/scripts/codespace-stack.sh clean` and `docker image prune -f` so the review environment does not drift onto reused local layers.

Cloud SQL `plant-sql-<env>` must be reached through the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy for IAM-based authentication — do not connect directly on port 5432.
The normal Codespaces path is the public-IP-backed proxy listener on `127.0.0.1:15432`; if the selected instance drifts to private-IP-only, first re-enable public IP with `gcloud sql instances patch plant-sql-${WAOOAW_CLOUDSQL_ENV:-demo} --assign-ip --project=waooaw-oauth --quiet`, then rerun `bash /workspaces/WAOOAW/.devcontainer/gcp-auth.sh`.

**Non-negotiable first-attempt rule:** do not start with ad-hoc `psql`, manual proxy commands, or package installs. Start with `bash /workspaces/WAOOAW/.devcontainer/gcp-auth.sh`, confirm the three success signals below, then run the query.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Environment selector | `WAOOAW_CLOUDSQL_ENV=demo|uat|prod` |
| Instance | `waooaw-oauth:asia-south1:plant-sql-${WAOOAW_CLOUDSQL_ENV}` |
| DB name | `plant` |
| DB user | `plant_app` |
| Local port | `15432` (via proxy) |
| Password | Stored in Secret Manager: `${WAOOAW_CLOUDSQL_ENV}-plant-database-url` by default (special chars — handled by `gcp-auth.sh`) |
| pgpass | `/root/.pgpass` (auto-written by `gcp-auth.sh`) |
| env file | `/root/.env.db` — `source /root/.env.db && psql` is all you need |

> **demo@waooaw.com test customer** (inserted 8 Mar 2026): `id = ce8cf044-b378-4d3d-b11d-4817074b08f6`.
> Required for dev-token auth — Plant `/api/v1/auth/validate` looks up this email on every request.

#### First-attempt checklist (follow exactly in order)

> `gcloud` is pre-installed in every normal WAOOAW Codespace. Do not install it unless `which gcloud` returns nothing.
> `gcp-auth.sh` is the only supported bootstrap path because it does four things in one go: activates the service account, starts the proxy, writes `/root/.pgpass`, and writes `/root/.env.db`.

```bash
# 1. Verify prerequisites
which gcloud
printenv GCP_SA_KEY >/dev/null && echo "GCP_SA_KEY present"

# 2. Select environment (demo is the default if you skip this line)
export WAOOAW_CLOUDSQL_ENV=demo

# Examples:
# export WAOOAW_CLOUDSQL_ENV=uat
# export WAOOAW_CLOUDSQL_ENV=prod

# 3. Run auth script — activates SA, starts proxy, writes /root/.env.db + /root/.pgpass
bash /workspaces/WAOOAW/.devcontainer/gcp-auth.sh

# Expected success signals
#   a) output contains: "✅ GCP auth active: waooaw-codespace-reader@waooaw-oauth.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
#   a1) output contains: "Target env: <env> | Instance: waooaw-oauth:asia-south1:plant-sql-<env> | Secret: <env>-plant-database-url"
#   b) output contains: "✅ Cloud SQL Proxy listening on 127.0.0.1:15432"
#   c) output contains: "✅ DB ready — connect: source /root/.env.db && psql"

# 4. Validate the bootstrap state before running real queries
gcloud auth list
test -f /root/.env.db && echo ".env.db ready"
test -f /root/.pgpass && echo ".pgpass ready"
pgrep -fa cloud-sql-proxy

# 5. Connect and verify
source /root/.env.db && psql -c "SELECT current_database(), current_user;"
psql -c "SELECT version_num FROM alembic_version;"

# 6. Optional sanity check against seeded data
psql -c "SELECT COUNT(*) AS customers FROM customer_entity;"
# Expected: 4 (yogeshkhandge@gmail.com, rupalikhandge@gmail.com, yogeshk7377@gmail.com, demo@waooaw.com)

# --- Only use recovery steps if the checklist above fails ---

# If the script printed "GCP_SA_KEY not set" then Codespaces secrets were not injected.
# Fix the secret first; re-running the script will not help until GCP_SA_KEY exists.

# If the proxy log says "instance does not have IP of type PUBLIC" then public IP drifted off.
tail -n 50 /tmp/cloud-sql-proxy.log
gcloud sql instances patch plant-sql-${WAOOAW_CLOUDSQL_ENV:-demo} --assign-ip --project=waooaw-oauth
# Wait ~30s for the patch, then re-run step 3

# If the proxy is missing or stale, restart it cleanly:
pkill -f cloud-sql-proxy 2>/dev/null || true
bash /workspaces/WAOOAW/.devcontainer/gcp-auth.sh

# Proxy diagnostics
tail -n 100 /tmp/cloud-sql-proxy.log  # full enough for failures
pgrep -fa cloud-sql-proxy             # empty means proxy not running
```

**Interpretation guide:** if `/root/.env.db` exists but `pgrep -fa cloud-sql-proxy` is empty, the script got credentials but the proxy is not alive. If both `/root/.env.db` and the proxy are present, query failures are almost always SQL-level issues, not connection bootstrap issues.

### How to test database locally

> **Docker-only rule**: `alembic` is not installed in the default Codespace shell environment — always run via Docker. Do not run `alembic upgrade head` directly on the host.

```bash
# 1. Start Postgres via Docker Compose
docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up db -d

# 2. Run migrations (Docker-only — no host alembic)
docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml run --rm plant-backend-test alembic upgrade head

# 3. Seed data
docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml run --rm plant-backend-test python -m database.seed_data

# 4. Run Plant backend via Docker (will auto-initialize DB)
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up plant-backend -d
```

### How to run migrations on GCP

- **Preferred (CI)**: Trigger `plant-db-migrations-job.yml` workflow (dispatches a Cloud Run job for `demo`/`uat`/`prod`)
- **Emergency / dev (Codespace)**: Run migration DDL directly via psql through the proxy

#### Running migrations via psql directly (when alembic unavailable)

> `alembic` is not installed in the default Codespace shell environment — use psql with the migration DDL directly.
> All migration files are in `src/Plant/BackEnd/database/migrations/versions/`.

```bash
# 1. Ensure proxy is running + env loaded
source /root/.env.db

# 2. Check current migration level
psql -c "SELECT version_num FROM alembic_version;"

# 3. Write migrations to a .sql file, then execute
# Use IF NOT EXISTS / DO $$ guards (idempotent) — see examples in migrations/versions/*.py
# Pattern for each migration:
#   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ...
#   DO $$ BEGIN IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM pg_constraint WHERE conname='...') THEN ALTER TABLE ... ADD CONSTRAINT ...; END IF; END $$;
#   CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS ...

# 4. Always update alembic_version at the end:
#   UPDATE alembic_version SET version_num = '023_performance_stats';

# 5. Run:
psql -f /tmp/my_migration.sql
```

#### Seeding `skill_entity` — CRITICAL: base_entity NOT NULL columns

`skill_entity` uses joined-table inheritance from `base_entity`. Both rows must be inserted.
`base_entity` has **18 NOT NULL columns** — use this exact template:

```sql
-- Idempotent pattern: upsert base_entity → upsert skill_entity in one CTE
WITH upserted_base AS (
    INSERT INTO base_entity (
        id, entity_type, external_id, governance_agent_id, status, version_hash,
        amendment_history, evolution_markers, l0_compliance_status, amendment_alignment,
        drift_detector, append_only, hash_chain_sha256, tamper_proof,
        tags, custom_attributes, child_ids, created_at, updated_at
    ) VALUES (
        gen_random_uuid(), 'Skill', 'my-skill-external-id', 'genesis', 'active', 'initial',
        '[]'::json, '{}'::json, '{}'::json, 'aligned',
        '{}'::json, true, '{}', true,
        '{domain_expertise}', '{}'::json, '{}', now(), now()
    )
    ON CONFLICT (external_id) DO UPDATE SET updated_at = now()
    RETURNING id
)
INSERT INTO skill_entity (id, name, description, category, goal_schema)
SELECT id, 'Skill Name', 'Description.', 'domain_expertise', '{...}'::jsonb
FROM upserted_base
ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET goal_schema = EXCLUDED.goal_schema;
```

> **Do NOT** use `INSERT INTO base_entity ... INSERT INTO skill_entity ...` as two separate statements
> without the CTE — the skill row will fail with `null value in column "version_hash"` (or similar).

### Database image

- Uses `pgvector/pgvector:pg15` (PostgreSQL 15 with pgvector extension)
- Extensions auto-loaded: `pgvector`, `uuid-ossp`

### Redis usage

| Service | Redis DB | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Plant Backend | 0 | Cache, sessions |
| Plant Gateway | 1 | Rate limiting, policy cache |
| PP Backend | 2 | Cache |
| CP Backend | 3 | Sessions, OTP storage |

### DB changes — PP Portal management screen (stop-gap)

As a stop-gap arrangement, the platform has provisioned a fast way to make DB changes via the PP portal's **DB Management screen**. This screen has a text box that executes one SQL statement at a time.

**Use this screen for any DB-related changes — DDL (CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, CREATE INDEX) or data (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) — on Demo, UAT, or Prod databases.**

Steps:
1. Open the PP portal → DB Management screen
2. Paste one SQL statement at a time into the text box
3. Execute and verify the response before running the next statement
4. Always run statements in migration order (lowest number first)

> Last verified: 2026-02-26. ⚠️ **STALE** — migrations 038–040 (PRs #1048, #1061, #1065) added `brand_voices`, `marketing_draft_batches`, `marketing_draft_posts`, `customer_platform_credentials` tables and new columns (`batch_type`, `parent_batch_id`, `credential_ref`, `secret_manager_ref`). Re-run the schema query in the PP portal DB Management screen after any DDL PR and update this table. Maintenance rule: update this table in the same PR as any Alembic migration.

## 11. Testing Strategy

### ⚠️ MANDATORY RULE: Codespace or Docker only — NO venv

> **All tests MUST run inside Docker containers or the Codespace devcontainer (which is itself a container — running `pytest` directly in a Codespace terminal is fully compliant).** Local-host virtual environments (`venv`, `virtualenv`, `conda`, `pip install` outside Docker/devcontainer) are **strictly prohibited** and will produce environment drift not reproducible in CI. Docker regression remains mandatory, but persistence stories also require a Cloud SQL demo migration/apply plus a live smoke query before the work is considered complete.

### Test suite locations (detailed)

| Suite type | Component | Path | Framework | Docker service | What to add here |
|-----------|-----------|------|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| **Unit** | Plant Backend | `src/Plant/BackEnd/tests/unit/` (70+ files) | pytest | `plant-backend` | Model changes, service logic, validators |

| **Web E2E** | CP + PP frontends | `src/CP/FrontEnd/e2e/`, `src/PP/FrontEnd/e2e/` | Playwright | local frontend Playwright containers | CP hire journey and PP operator smoke |
| **Mobile E2E** | Mobile | `tests/e2e/mobile/` | Maestro | device-backed opt-in lane | OTP auth, hire flow, and checkpointed notification runtime re-entry YAML |

### Docker-based test infrastructure

| File | Purpose |
|------|--------|
| `tests/docker-compose.test.yml` | Isolated test stack (postgres-test on :5433, redis-test on :6380) |
| `tests/Dockerfile.test` | Test runner image (Python 3.11 + git + test deps) |
| `tests/requirements.txt` | Test-specific Python dependencies |
| `docker-compose.local.yml` → `cp-frontend-test` | CP frontend test container (Vitest) |
| `docker-compose.local.yml` → `pp-frontend-test` | PP frontend test container (Vitest) |
| `docker-compose.test.yml` | **Dedicated regression test stack** — includes plant-backend-test, cp-backend-test, pp-backend-test, playwright, maestro, locust, zap services |
| `scripts/test-web.sh` | Convenience wrapper — runs backend regression plus the CP/PP Playwright journey specs in Docker |
| `scripts/test-mobile.sh` | Convenience wrapper — runs mobile Jest/accessibility by default; native Maestro remains opt-in via `RUN_MOBILE_NATIVE_E2E=1` |
| `.github/workflows/waooaw-regression.yml` | Manual `workflow_dispatch` regression — 9 stages, `scope=full\|quick` |
| `.github/workflows/mobile-regression.yml` | Manual `workflow_dispatch` mobile regression — 6 stages |

### Regression testing per iteration — MANDATORY

> **Every iteration PR that merges to `main` requires the steps below.** Run the smoke + unit check *before* opening a PR, and the doc update *immediately after* merging. Do NOT wait for an epic or story to complete — update after each iteration.

#### Before merging (developer gate — run in Codespace)

```bash
# 1. Smoke: all services pass, no regression introduced
docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml run --rm plant-backend-test pytest src/Plant/BackEnd/tests/ -x -q
docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml run --rm cp-backend-test pytest src/CP/BackEnd/tests/ -x -q

# 2. If the iteration touches Plant BE models/migration:
docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml run --rm plant-backend-test pytest -m integration -v

# 3. If the iteration touches CP FrontEnd components:
docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml run --rm cp-frontend-test npx vitest run --reporter verbose
```

#### After merging (PM/developer — update docs)

1. **Open `docs/testing/ExistingTestAssets.md`** and update the service row(s) affected:
   - Increment the test file count
   - List the new test file path and what it covers
   - Update the `Last updated` field to the merged PR number

2. **Add a row to §12 "Latest Changes & Recent PRs"** in this file (the normal process).

3. **If a new test type was introduced** (BDD spec, property test, Pact consumer, Playwright spec):
   - Update the relevant Epic story status in `docs/testing/TestingEpics.md` to ✅ Done

#### What to check per change type

| Change in the iteration | Required test check | Doc to update |
|------------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| New Plant BE model/migration | `pytest -m integration` — verify migration columns exist | `ExistingTestAssets.md` Plant BE row |
| New Plant BE endpoint | Unit test file in `tests/unit/` + Plant Gateway policy test | `ExistingTestAssets.md` Plant BE + Gateway rows |
| New CP BE proxy route | Unit test in `src/CP/BackEnd/tests/` | `ExistingTestAssets.md` CP BE row |
| New CP FE component | React component test in `src/CP/FrontEnd/src/__tests__/` | `ExistingTestAssets.md` CP FE row |
| New service/env flag (Terraform) | No test required — document in §12 as config change | §12 table |
| Alembic migration | Assert new columns present in `test_alembic_migrations.py` | `ExistingTestAssets.md` Plant BE row |
| Gateway RBAC policy change | Update `src/Plant/Gateway/middleware/tests/test_proxy.py` allowed paths | `ExistingTestAssets.md` Gateway row |

|----|--------|---------|----------|
| **#1065** | `fix/credential-resolver-publish-path` | **DMA staged theme→content workflow + migration 040 + BDD/TDD tests** — adds `batch_type` ENUM (`theme`/`content`) and `parent_batch_id` FK on `marketing_draft_batches` (migration 040, applied to demo 2026-04-15); Plant API exposes `POST /api/v1/marketing-drafts/batches/{id}/create-content-batch`; CP proxy `POST /cp/marketing-review/batches/{id}/create-content-batch`; two-stage DMA wizard UI (approve themes → generate content); BDD scenarios in `dma_staged_workflow.feature`; 8 bootstrap TDD tests; CI fixes. | `src/Plant/BackEnd/database/migrations/versions/040_dma_batch_type_workflow.py` (new), `src/Plant/BackEnd/api/v1/marketing_drafts.py`, `src/CP/BackEnd/api/marketing_review.py`, `src/CP/FrontEnd/src/components/DigitalMarketingActivationWizard.tsx`, `src/Plant/BackEnd/tests/bdd/features/dma_staged_workflow.feature` (new), `src/Plant/BackEnd/tests/bdd/test_dma_staged_workflow.py` (new), `src/Plant/BackEnd/tests/unit/test_dma_dependency_bootstrap.py` (new), `src/Plant/BackEnd/tests/unit/test_dma_schema_integrity.py` (new) |
| **#1064** | `fix/dma-labels-draft-reload` | **Honest DMA labels + draft reload + SECRET_MANAGER_BACKEND + workflow tests** — video post type now labelled "Video Script" instead of generic "Post"; draft batches reload after approval so stale UI state is eliminated; Plant Backend Terraform adds `SECRET_MANAGER_BACKEND=gcp` env var so `GcpSecretManagerAdapter` is selected in Cloud Run; frontend error detail surfaced on publish failure; 3 new workflow-level tests. | `src/Plant/BackEnd/api/v1/marketing_drafts.py`, `src/CP/FrontEnd/src/components/DigitalMarketingActivationWizard.tsx`, `cloud/terraform/stacks/plant/main.tf`, `src/Plant/BackEnd/tests/unit/test_dma_full_workflow.py` |

### Pending (unmerged) work — 2026-02-24

|---|---|---|
| Mobile Google Sign-In fix | **PR #755** — Added Play App Signing SHA-1 (`8fd589b1…`) as a second type-1 Android OAuth client entry in `google-services.json`. Resolves `DEVELOPER_ERROR` (error code 10) on Google Sign-In for Play Store builds. Root cause: Google Play re-signs AABs with its own key; the device-installed APK's certificate SHA-1 did not match the EAS upload keystore SHA-1 that was previously the only registered entry. Manual steps also completed: SHA-1 added to Firebase Console (waooaw-oauth → `com.waooaw.app`) and GCP OAuth Android client (`270293855600-2shlgots…`). | `src/mobile/google-services.json` |

## 13. Code File Index

### Fast-path index for runtime routing and vocabulary

Use this shortlist first when the task is about Agent/Skill/Component runtime behaviour or CP route drift.

| Need | First file | Then inspect | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Canonical runtime vocabulary | `docs/PP/AGENT-CONSTRUCT-DESIGN.md` | `docs/CONTEXT_AND_INDEX.md` §4.6–§4.7 | Executable runtime source of truth for AgentSpec, hired-agent hierarchy, construct bindings, lifecycle hooks, skills, runs, and deliverables |
| Current agent-management and catalog direction | `docs/WAOOAW_agents.md` | `docs/PP/AGENT-CONSTRUCT-DESIGN.md`, `src/Plant/BackEnd/agent_mold/reference_agents.py`, `src/Plant/BackEnd/api/v1/reference_agents.py` | Fastest way to recover the live runtime vocabulary, hire-ready supply model, and catalog-facing API surfaces |
| DMA customer setup and approval loop | `src/CP/FrontEnd/src/pages/HireSetupWizard.tsx` | `src/CP/BackEnd/api/marketing_review.py`, `src/Plant/BackEnd/api/v1/marketing_drafts.py`, `src/Plant/BackEnd/agent_mold/skills/publisher_engine.py` | Shortest path from customer setup to draft generation, approval, and publish flow |
| DMA conversation + theme generation loop | `src/Plant/BackEnd/api/v1/digital_marketing_activation.py` | `src/CP/FrontEnd/src/components/DigitalMarketingActivationWizard.tsx`, `src/CP/FrontEnd/src/services/digitalMarketingActivation.service.ts`, `src/Plant/BackEnd/services/content_analytics.py` | Owns the DMA chat, required-fields gate, strategy workshop, derived theme generation, gated deliverable rule, and auto-draft creation. Start here for any DMA content-calendar or table-generation issue |
| Legacy marketing flow-run path | `src/CP/BackEnd/api/cp_flow_runs.py` | `src/Plant/BackEnd/api/v1/flow_runs.py`, `src/Plant/BackEnd/marketing_agent_flows.py`, `src/Plant/BackEnd/flow_executor.py` | Use this when a task mentions old DMA flow definitions or run-history APIs |
| CP hired-agent skills flow | `src/CP/FrontEnd/src/services/agentSkills.service.ts` | `src/CP/BackEnd/api/cp_skills.py` → `src/Plant/BackEnd/api/v1/agent_skills.py` | Full FE → proxy → Plant chain |
| Customer skill config save | `src/CP/BackEnd/api/cp_skills.py` | `src/Plant/BackEnd/api/v1/skill_configs.py` | Canonical hired-agent skill config write path |
| Skill/component run history | `src/CP/BackEnd/api/cp_flow_runs.py` | `src/Plant/BackEnd/api/v1/flow_runs.py` | CP proxy and Plant route registration meet here |
| Approval queue and review actions | `src/CP/BackEnd/api/cp_approvals_proxy.py` | `src/Plant/BackEnd/api/v1/deliverables_simple.py` | Prevents drift back to nonexistent deliverable status patch paths |
| Hired-agent identity lookup | `src/Plant/BackEnd/api/v1/hired_agents_simple.py` | `src/Plant/BackEnd/tests/unit/test_hired_agents_api.py` | Canonical by-id surface and validation entry point |
| Share Trader runtime path | `src/Plant/BackEnd/share_trader_flows.py` | `src/Plant/BackEnd/api/v1/trading.py`, `src/CP/BackEnd/api/trading.py`, `src/Plant/BackEnd/integrations/delta_exchange/client.py` | Shortest route into trading setup, execution boundaries, and exchange integration |

### Fast-path index for platform ownership and operations

Use this shortlist when the task is broader than runtime routes.

| Need | First file | Then inspect | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| CP page bug or wrong API call | `src/CP/FrontEnd/src/services/` | `src/CP/BackEnd/api/` | Most CP breakage starts with the FE service calling the wrong proxy |
| PP operator workflow issue | `src/PP/FrontEnd/src/pages/` | `src/PP/BackEnd/api/` | PP remains a UI + thin-proxy/admin stack |
| Gateway auth/RBAC/policy issue | `src/Plant/Gateway/main.py` | `src/Plant/Gateway/middleware/` | Gateway owns ingress enforcement, not Plant BackEnd |
| Plant business-logic bug | `src/Plant/BackEnd/api/v1/router.py` | `src/Plant/BackEnd/services/`, `src/Plant/BackEnd/models/` | Confirms mounted route, service path, and persistence layer |
| Mobile feature or auth issue | `src/mobile/src/` | §23 + Plant Gateway auth endpoints | Mobile often talks to Gateway directly |
| Docker/local stack issue | `docker-compose.local.yml` | `docker-compose.test.yml`, `infrastructure/docker/` | Distinguishes dev stack from regression stack and support assets |
| Deploy, Cloud Run, or Terraform issue | `.github/workflows/waooaw-deploy.yml` | `cloud/terraform/`, `cloud/terraform/stacks/`, `cloud/terraform/environments/` | Build/push/apply ownership lives here |
| Logging/metrics/debug work | `src/Plant/BackEnd/core/logging.py` | `src/Plant/BackEnd/core/metrics.py`, `src/PP/BackEnd/core/observability.py`, `infrastructure/monitoring/` | Fastest path into observability ownership |
| Database or migration issue | `src/Plant/BackEnd/core/database.py` | `src/Plant/BackEnd/models/`, `src/Plant/BackEnd/database/migrations/`, §10 | DB truth belongs to Plant, not to portal services |

### Root directory

|------|---------|
| `README.md` | Project overview, quick start, architecture |
| `docker-compose.local.yml` | Full local dev stack (Postgres, Redis, Plant, PP, CP, Gateway) |
| `docker-compose.test.yml` | Dedicated regression stack — backend, frontend, E2E, perf, security test containers |
| `docker-compose.mobile.yml` | Mobile-specific local/test stack support |
| `pytest.ini` | Root pytest configuration |
| `.env.example` | Template for environment variables |

| `start-local-no-docker.sh` | Run services without Docker |
| `coverage.xml` | Test coverage report |
| `session_commentary.md` | Append-only agent context journal — run `tail -120 session_commentary.md` at every session start (§25); never edit or delete past entries |

| `trial_status_simple.py` | Trial status endpoints |
| `audit.py` | Audit log endpoints |
| `auth.py` | Authentication endpoints — `POST /auth/google/verify`, `POST /auth/validate`, `POST /auth/register` (mobile registration), `POST /auth/otp/start` (mobile OTP challenge), `POST /auth/otp/verify` (mobile OTP → JWT) |
| `otp.py` | OTP session lifecycle — create session, deliver email/SMS, verify code, revoke (added PR #822) |

| `main.py` | Gateway app with middleware stack + proxy (787 lines) |
| `middleware/auth.py` | JWT validation middleware — `PUBLIC_ENDPOINTS` list controls unauthenticated access. Currently public: `/auth/google/verify`, `/auth/validate`, `/auth/register`, `/auth/otp/start`, `/auth/otp/verify` (and their `/api/v1/` prefixed equivalents) |
| `middleware/rbac.py` | Role-based access control |
| `middleware/policy.py` | OPA policy enforcement |
| `middleware/budget.py` | Budget guard middleware |

| `api/cp_registration.py` | Customer registration endpoint |
| `api/cp_registration_otp.py` | Pre-registration OTP for **CP web only** — verify email ownership before full registration (added PR #822). ⚠️ Mobile does **NOT** use this path; mobile calls Plant Gateway `/auth/register` + `/auth/otp/start` + `/auth/otp/verify` directly (see §23). |
| `api/cp_otp.py` | OTP verification (post-registration 2FA) |

| `services/cp_approvals.py` | CP-side approval request forwarding to gateway |
| `services/cp_refresh_revocations.py` | Token refresh revocation management |
| `services/cp_subscriptions_simple.py` | Simplified subscription read queries |
| `services/secret_manager.py` | Cloud-portable credential storage — `SecretManagerAdapter` ABC with two implementations: `GcpSecretManagerAdapter` (ADC, no key file; used in demo/uat/prod) and `LocalSecretManagerAdapter` (in-memory dict; used locally and in CI). Toggled by `SECRET_MANAGER_BACKEND` env var. Secret naming convention: `hired-{hired_instance_id}-{platform_key}`. (PLANT-SKILLS-1 It3 #846) |
| `services/exchange_setup.py` | Exchange credential setup and validation service |
| `services/plant_client.py` | Direct Plant Backend HTTP client (for internal CP→Plant calls bypassing Gateway) |
| `services/plant_gateway_client.py` | HTTP client to Plant Gateway — has class-level `_circuit_breaker` (3 failures→OPEN, 30s recovery) |
| `services/platform_credentials.py` | Platform credential storage and retrieval service |
| `services/audit_dependency.py` | `AuditLogger` class + `get_audit_logger` FastAPI dependency — fire-and-forget audit events |
| `services/audit_client.py` | Low-level HTTP client to audit service — never call directly from routes, use `audit_dependency` |
| `core/routing.py` | `waooaw_router()` factory — use instead of bare `APIRouter()` in all `api/` files |
| `core/dependencies.py` | `require_correlation_id` — reads/generates `X-Correlation-ID`; wired globally in `main.py` |
| `pyproject.toml` | ruff TID251 ban on bare `from fastapi import APIRouter` in `api/` directories |

## 14. Environment Variables Quick Reference

| Variable | Used by | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Plant, CP | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `REDIS_URL` | All services | Redis connection |
| `JWT_SECRET` | All services | **MUST be identical** across CP, PP, Plant, Gateway |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | CP, PP, Gateway | Google OAuth2 client ID |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Gateway, GCP | Google OAuth2 secret |
| `CP_REGISTRATION_KEY` | CP, Gateway | Shared secret for customer upsert authorization |
| `TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` | CP Frontend | Cloudflare Turnstile CAPTCHA (public) |
| `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` | CP Backend | Cloudflare Turnstile CAPTCHA (server) |
| `PLANT_GATEWAY_URL` | CP, PP | URL to Plant Gateway (default: http://localhost:8000) |
| `OPA_URL` | Plant Gateway | HTTPS URL to Plant OPA Cloud Run service — set by Terraform `module.plant_opa.service_url`; use `http://localhost:8181` locally |
| `OPA_SERVICE_URL` | Plant Gateway | Back-compat alias for `OPA_URL` — kept in sync |
| `ENVIRONMENT` | All | development / demo / uat / prod |
| `ENABLE_DB_UPDATES` | Plant | Enable DB update endpoints |
| `GCP_PROJECT_ID` | Terraform, Plant, CP BackEnd | GCP project identifier — required when `SECRET_MANAGER_BACKEND=gcp` |
| `SECRET_MANAGER_BACKEND` | CP BackEnd | `gcp` (demo/uat/prod via Terraform) or `local` (default for CI and local dev) — switches between `GcpSecretManagerAdapter` and `LocalSecretManagerAdapter` |
| `XAI_API_KEY` | Plant BackEnd | Grok API key (from [console.x.ai](https://console.x.ai)) — enables live AI content generation in `ContentCreatorSkill` and `ContentPublisherSkill`; absent (or `EXECUTOR_BACKEND` not `"grok"`) means deterministic template mode (zero API cost, zero dependency) (PLANT-CONTENT-1 #869). |
| `EXECUTOR_BACKEND` | Plant BackEnd | `"grok"` → use Grok API for content generation; any other value (or absent) → deterministic templates. Per-agent default — can be overridden via `ConstructBindings.processor_config` in future phases. (PLANT-CONTENT-1 #869). |
| `CAMPAIGN_PERSISTENCE_MODE` | Plant BackEnd | `"db"` (default) → campaign writes go to PostgreSQL; `"memory"` is explicit test-only fallback. |
| `SCHEDULER_ENABLED` | Plant BackEnd | `"true"` (default) → all Scheduler firing is active; `"false"` → disable firing (test only). |
| `APPROVAL_GATE_ENABLED` | Plant BackEnd | `"true"` (default) → `ApprovalGateHook` active at `PRE_PUBLISH`; `"false"` → bypass gate in dev/demo. |
| `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_ENABLED` | Plant BackEnd | `"true"` (default); set `"false"` in unit tests only to avoid CB interference. |

## 17. Gotchas & Tribal Knowledge

| Topic | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| JWT_SECRET sync | ALL services (CP, PP, Plant, Gateway) **must** use the exact same JWT_SECRET value. Mismatches cause silent 401 errors. |
| CP_REGISTRATION_KEY | Shared secret between CP Backend and Plant Gateway to authorize customer creation. Must be set in both services. |
| Database ownership | Only Plant Backend writes to the main DB. CP and PP proxy through Gateway. |
| CP is a thin proxy | CP Backend routes most requests to Plant Gateway via `httpx`. Only auth/registration/OTP is handled locally. |
| PP is a thin proxy | PP Backend delegates to `main_proxy.py` which proxies to Plant Gateway. |
| Gateway middleware order matters | Error handler → Auth → RBAC → Policy → Budget → Audit → Proxy. Changing order breaks security. |
| Alembic migrations | Run from `src/Plant/BackEnd/`. The `alembic.ini` file lives there. |
| pgvector | Database uses `pgvector/pgvector:pg15` image. Extensions auto-load on first connection. |
| Scale to zero | Demo/UAT Cloud Run services scale to 0 instances. First request has cold start (~5s). |
| Constitutional validators | Every entity MUST pass `validate_self()` before persistence. Violations raise `ConstitutionalAlignmentError`. |
| Agent mold playbooks | Agent behavior templates in `src/Plant/BackEnd/agent_mold/playbooks/`. Currently: `marketing/multichannel_post_v1.md`, `trading/delta_futures_manual_v1.md`. Skills library: `agent_mold/skills/` — see §4.6 for full index. |
| AgentSpec is in-memory only | `AgentSpec` / `ConstructBindings` / `ConstraintPolicy` / `LifecycleHooks` are created at startup from `reference_agents.py` and held in RAM. **There is no DB table for AgentSpec.** Only `agent_type_entity` (reference data) and `hired_agents` (customer instance) are persisted. |
| Processor constitutional rule | `BaseProcessor.execute()` **must NOT** access the database, manage credentials, or call the Publisher. It is purely computational. This makes every Processor unit-testable without mocking external APIs. |
| secret_ref is write-only | `platform_connections.secret_ref` is stored but **never returned in any GET response**. Only `CredentialResolver` can resolve it at runtime. Any GET of `/platform-connections` deliberately omits `secret_ref`. |
| TradingProcessor is always draft-only | `TradingProcessorOutput(draft_only=True)` always. Real order placement only happens inside `on_deliverable_approved` hook → `DeltaTradeAdapter.publish()`. Never short-circuit this. |
| ConstructBindings.processor_class is required | Every `AgentSpec` must declare its `processor_class`. An agent with no Processor cannot fire — Scheduler will raise `PermanentError` on the first attempt and DLQ it. |
| DimensionContract.register_hooks() | Each dimension's `register_hooks()` is called at mould compilation. Currently `BasicDimension` is a no-op — `TrialDimension` and `BudgetDimension` are being wired in MOULD-GAP-1. Do not add quota / budget enforcement inside service code — it belongs in the mould. |
| GitHub Actions concurrency | ALM workflow uses concurrency groups (vg-$issue, ba-sa-$issue, testing-$epic, deploy-$epic) to prevent duplicates. |
| go-coding label | Governor must manually apply `go-coding` label to an epic before Code Agent can run — this is a deliberate human gate. |
| Docker compose profiles | Use `docker-compose.local.yml` for full local dev. No separate test/prod compose currently. |
| Redis DB assignments | Each service uses a different Redis DB (0-3). Don't share DB indices. |
| Codespace browser URLs | Use `https://${CODESPACE_NAME}-{PORT}.${GITHUB_CODESPACES_PORT_FORWARDING_DOMAIN}/` format. |
| No docs without asking | AI agents must NOT auto-create documentation files — always ask user first. |
| **`waooaw_router()` is mandatory everywhere** | Never use bare `APIRouter()` in any `api/` directory across CP, Plant, or PP. Ruff TID251 bans it in CI. Use `from core.routing import waooaw_router`. Core routing files: `src/CP/BackEnd/core/routing.py`, `src/Plant/BackEnd/core/routing.py`, `src/PP/BackEnd/core/routing.py`. |
| **DMA gated deliverable rule (PR #1052)** | `digital_marketing_activation.py` has a gated deliverable rule: the LLM is instructed to produce a content-calendar table **only** when all `CORE_REQUIRED_FIELDS` (industry, platforms, goals, audience, frequency, budget) are present. If you add new required fields, update both `CORE_REQUIRED_FIELDS` and `_FIELD_PURPOSE`. If the DMA returns conversational filler instead of tables, check whether fields are missing or `derived_themes` is empty. |
| **DMA `draft_ready` normalization defect (known)** | `_normalize_strategy_workshop()` resets `draft_ready` to `not_started` on every normalization call. This defeats the two-tier readiness gate (`draft_ready` / `approval_ready`). Flagged in DMA-MEDIA-1 plan — must be fixed before DMA-MEDIA-1 implementation starts. |
| **DMA test files — naming convention** | DMA unit tests follow `test_dma_<aspect>.py` naming: `test_dma_prompt_fields.py`, `test_dma_auto_draft.py`, `test_dma_brand_voice.py`, `test_dma_feedback_loop.py`, `test_dma_market_context.py`, `test_dma_table_generation.py`, `test_posting_time.py`. Integration test: `test_dma_e2e.py`. The older `test_digital_marketing_theme_generation_api.py` and `test_digital_marketing_activation_api.py` predate the DMA-CONV-1 convention. |
| **OPA is Gate 1; Plant Backend is Gate 2** | Plant Gateway middleware queries OPA for RBAC/policy decisions (Gate 1 — role-level). Plant Backend `/api/v1/admin/db/*` has its own hard admin-role check `_require_admin_via_gateway` (Gate 2). A non-admin role may pass OPA Gate 1 for `resource="admin"` (level-based) but will be rejected at Gate 2. Never remove either gate. |
| **OPA Dockerfile — never add env-specific values** | `src/Plant/Gateway/opa/Dockerfile` must not contain env names, GCP URLs, secrets, or environment labels. Runtime config (log level only) is passed as Cloud Run env vars at deploy time. Image is built once and promoted demo → uat → prod. |
| **OPA CI test — use static binary, not Docker bind-mount** | GitHub Actions overlay filesystem rejects bind-mounts (`-v` flag on `docker run`). CI downloads `opa_linux_amd64_static` from GitHub releases and runs `opa test src/Plant/Gateway/opa -v` natively. Do NOT revert to `docker run -v`. |
| **Stacked PRs — always verify base branch after first PR merges** | When PR A and PR B are stacked (B based on A), merging A to main does NOT automatically rebase B to main. GitHub keeps B's base pointing at A's old branch. B's merge will land on the stale branch, not main. Always verify with `gh pr view <N> --json baseRefName` after merging the parent. Cherry-pick to main if needed (see PR #845 — #844 merged into `feat/PLANT-OPA-1-it1-e1` instead of `main`). |
| **OPA cold start on Cloud Run** | OPA service (`waooaw-plant-opa-{env}`) scales to zero on demo/uat (min_instances=0). First request after idle will hit an OPA cold start (~3s). Plant Gateway middleware has a circuit breaker — fails open on timeout rather than 500ing. For prod, set `min_instances=1` on the OPA module to eliminate cold-start latency. |
| **Correlation ID via ContextVar** | `require_correlation_id` is wired globally on all 4 apps. To read the current correlation ID anywhere in a request (e.g. in a service): `from core.dependencies import _correlation_id; cid = _correlation_id.get()`. Never pass correlation ID as a function argument — read from context. |
| **Audit = fire-and-forget only** | Always use `get_audit_logger` dependency in routes. Never call `AuditClient` directly from route handlers. All `audit.log()` calls schedule the HTTP call as an asyncio task — they never block the response. |
| **Read replica = GET/query operations ONLY** | `get_read_db_session()` for any endpoint that only reads. `get_db_session()` only for INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE. Rule enforced by code review — not a lint check. |
| **Circuit breakers are class-level, not per-request** | `_circuit_breaker` is a `ClassVar` (or module-level singleton). Do NOT create a new `CircuitBreaker()` instance inside `__init__` or per-request — state would be lost between requests. |
| **PII masking is automatic** | `PIIMaskingFilter` is wired at the root logger. Don't try to mask fields manually in route code. Debug by correlation ID or user_id — not by email (masked in logs). |
| **C8 (PII DB encryption) is PARKED** | Decision: never implement application-layer field encryption for `email`/`phone`/`full_name`. CMEK + masking + email_hash + GDPR erasure cover the compliance requirement. See Section 5.6. |
| **GCP auth is permanent in Codespace** | `waooaw-codespace-reader` SA activates automatically via `gcp-auth.sh` on every Codespace start. Run `gcloud auth list` to verify. Cloud SQL Proxy starts on port 15432 automatically. No user action needed. |
| **`smoke-mobile-routes.sh`: `probe()` vs `probe_tracked()`** | `probe()` calls `curl` and exits 1 on 404 — use for routes that **must** exist on demo (breaks CI if absent). `probe_tracked()` is informational-only — use for routes that are **known-undeployed** on demo (e.g. `/auth/register` as of 2026-04-17) so the script logs the miss without failing the CI job. Never switch a known-404 route from `probe_tracked()` to `probe()` without first confirming it is deployed; doing so will fail CI for every PR. |
| **Cloud SQL Auth Proxy required** | Always connect to `plant-sql-demo` via Cloud SQL Auth Proxy on `127.0.0.1:15432` for IAM auth. Never connect directly on port 5432. If you get `connection refused` on 15432, proxy is not running — restart with `bash .devcontainer/gcp-auth.sh`. If proxy startup or first connect fails with `instance does not have IP of type "PUBLIC"`, run `gcloud sql instances patch plant-sql-demo --assign-ip --project=waooaw-oauth --quiet`, wait for the operation to finish, then rerun the auth script. On cleaned-up devcontainer branches, gcloud comes from the devcontainer feature rather than the old shell bootstrap; `source /root/.env.db && psql` is still the canonical connect path after the proxy starts. For persistence work, this demo DB is the canonical validation target before Docker regression. |
| **SA role scope** | `waooaw-codespace-reader` has `cloudsql.admin` — can patch Cloud SQL settings (e.g. `gcloud sql instances patch plant-sql-demo --assign-ip`). Has `secretmanager.secretAccessor` — can read all secret values. |
| **Image promotion — no env baking** | **ONE image built once, promoted unchanged through demo → uat → prod.** All env-specific config MUST come from env vars (non-sensitive) or GCP Secret Manager (sensitive) — injected by terraform at deploy time. See §8.1 for the full checklist and §19 for code examples. **Terraform template anti-pattern that is BANNED**: `SOME_VAR = var.x != "" ? var.x : (var.environment == "demo" ? "value_a" : "value_b")` — this bakes environment-conditional logic into the template. Defaults belong in `variables.tf default =`, not in `main.tf` ternaries. Violations are reverted on review. This was found and fixed in PR #851 for CP Backend `PAYMENTS_MODE` and `OTP_DELIVERY_MODE`. |
| **Plant Gateway needs the shared VPC connector for Redis-backed flows** | Plant Gateway now depends on Memorystore-backed Redis paths used in customer signup and related throttled/runtime operations. Keep the shared VPC connector attached for private ranges while leaving public egress direct; removing it can break Redis-backed flows even when public HTTP ingress still looks healthy. |
| **CP web auth is memory-only** | CP FrontEnd keeps the access token only in memory and relies on `POST /auth/refresh` plus the `waooaw:session-restorable` hint to recover after reload. When debugging login loops or post-redirect sign-outs, inspect `src/CP/FrontEnd/src/services/auth.service.ts` and `src/CP/FrontEnd/src/context/AuthContext.tsx` first. |
| **Connected-platform OAuth should finish on a public callback surface** | With memory-only web auth, a full-page Google/YouTube redirect can reload the app before a protected wizard has restored the session. If you add or refactor an external OAuth flow, complete the exchange on a public callback route or other non-protected surface, restore session there, then navigate back into the protected experience. |
| **`SecretManagerAdapter` — never call GCP SDK directly in routes** | CP BackEnd `services/secret_manager.py` provides the ABC. Routes call `get_secret_manager_adapter()` which reads `SECRET_MANAGER_BACKEND`. For `local`/CI: in-memory `LocalSecretManagerAdapter`. For `gcp`: `GcpSecretManagerAdapter` using Application Default Credentials on Cloud Run — no key file needed. Never instantiate `secretmanager.SecretManagerServiceClient` directly in a route or service other than `GcpSecretManagerAdapter`. |
| **Platform credential secrets — naming convention** | Platform connection credentials are stored as GCP Secret Manager secrets named `hired-{hired_instance_id}-{platform_key}`. The returned `secret_ref` is the full GCP resource path (e.g., `projects/waooaw-oauth/secrets/hired-abc123-instagram/versions/latest`). Only the `secret_ref` is forwarded to Plant BE and persisted in `platform_connections.secret_ref`. Raw credentials never leave CP BackEnd. |
| **CP BackEnd SA needs `secretmanager.secretVersionAdder`** | On first deploy of PLANT-SKILLS-1 It3 (#846), verify CP BackEnd's Cloud Run SA has `roles/secretmanager.secretVersionAdder` (or `roles/secretmanager.admin`). Without it, `POST /cp/hired-agents/{id}/platform-connections` will return 500. Check: `gcloud projects get-iam-policy waooaw-oauth --flatten="bindings[].members" --filter="bindings.members:serviceAccount:waooaw-cp-backend@waooaw-oauth.iam.gserviceaccount.com" --format="table(bindings.role)"` |
| **OPA `delete_agent` mis-classification (fixed PR #846)** | Before #846, `DELETE /api/v1/agents/{id}/skills/{skill_id}` was classified as `action=delete_agent` in `policy.py`, triggering the `SENSITIVE_ACTIONS` governor_role check. Fixed: `delete_agent` now only fires when `len(parts) <= 2`; deeper paths (sub-resources like `skills`) use `resource=parts[2]`, `action=delete`. |
| **Google Sign-In — never use `tokeninfo`** | The `tokeninfo` HTTP endpoint is banned by Google for production (debug-only). All three backends (CP, PP, Plant) use `google.oauth2.id_token.verify_oauth2_token()` from `google-auth[requests]>=2.25.0`. This validates RSA signature locally via cached JWKs and enforces `aud`, `iss`, `exp`. |
| **Google Sign-In — `aud` = Web client ID** | `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` in GCP Secret Manager (project `waooaw-oauth`) must be the **Web client ID** (`270293855600-uoag582a…`), NOT the Android client ID. Plant backend reads this via `settings.google_client_id`. Already verified correct. |
| **Google Sign-In — Play App Signing SHA-1** | When distributing via Play Store (even internal testing), Google re-signs the AAB. The device presents Play App Signing SHA-1 to GCP OAuth, not the EAS keystore SHA-1. **FIXED (PR #755, 2026-02-24)**: Play App Signing SHA-1 `8F:D5:89:B1:20:14:85:E3:73:E8:0C:C0:B0:1B:56:74:E5:2F:5F:FA` is now registered in: (1) `google-services.json` (type-1 Android OAuth client), (2) Firebase Console → waooaw-oauth → `com.waooaw.app` → SHA certificate fingerprints, (3) GCP Console → Credentials → Android OAuth client `270293855600-2shlgots…`. Access: Play Console → Your app → Setup → App integrity → App signing → App signing key certificate. |
| **`eas build:view` has no `--non-interactive` flag** | The flag is invalid and causes a hard failure. CI uses `eas build:view "$BUILD_ID" --json` (no flag). EAS CLI emits spinner text before the JSON; always strip with `awk '/^[{\[]/{found=1} found{print}'` before piping to `jq`. |
| **EAS `test-apk` profile** | Direct APK install that bypasses Play Store re-signing. Uses EAS keystore SHA-1 (`14f7ccef…`) which is already registered in GCP. Use this for testing Google Sign-In without Play Store. Download from Expo dashboard, install with "unknown sources" enabled. |
| **PP runtime config must stay runtime-loaded** | `src/PP/FrontEnd/pp-runtime-config.js` is deployment-time config, not a bundled source module. Do not add it back to `index.html` as a static script include if Vite starts warning or trying to process it. Load it from `src/main.tsx` before rendering so runtime env injection stays external and build output stays clean. |
| **Mobile Jest `isolatedModules` belongs in tsconfig** | Keep `"isolatedModules": true` in `src/mobile/tsconfig.json`, not as an inline `ts-jest` transform option. The ts-jest warning is non-actionable noise there, while the TypeScript config preserves the intended transpile behavior. |
| **Mobile service files MUST use full `/api/v1/<path>` — never `/v1/<path>`** | `apiBaseUrl` in `src/mobile/src/config/api.config.ts` is set to the bare domain (e.g. `https://plant.demo.waooaw.com`) with NO path prefix. Every mobile service file must supply the full path starting with `/api/v1/` (e.g. `apiClient.get('/api/v1/agents')`). Writing `/v1/agents` silently produces 404 in production — requests hit a non-existent path and return 404, not 401/403. This means all tests pass (mocked at service layer) but every real API call fails. The same rule applies to CP FrontEnd `gatewayRequestJson` calls. Cross-check every path against the Route Ownership table in §5.2 before writing a story card. |
| **Mobile token refresh path must be verified before building any authenticated screen** | `src/mobile/src/lib/apiClient.ts` posts token refresh to `${apiBaseUrl}/auth/refresh`. Verify this exact path is mounted on Plant Gateway using: `curl -sS -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" -X POST https://plant.demo.waooaw.com/auth/refresh`. If it returns 404, every post-login screen will fail with cascading 401s after the first token expiry. See §23 for the list of public auth paths. Any plan that builds authenticated mobile screens must include this curl as a done-gate in its Integration Baseline Gate section. |
| **Mobile Jest tests mocking at service layer give false coverage confidence** | Mocking `apiClient` or service modules at the module boundary lets tests pass even when the underlying path is wrong. Plans for mobile work must include at least one Pact consumer stub per new Gateway call (file: `src/mobile/pact/` or `src/CP/BackEnd/tests/pact/consumer/`). Pact tests assert the actual request path and response shape — they catch path-prefix bugs that unit mocks cannot. See §11 for the Pact contract test lane. |

## 18. Free Model Selection Guide

> **INSTRUCTION TO AI AGENT**: When a user describes a task, you MUST consult this section and recommend the best free model BEFORE starting work. State the model name, why it's the best fit, and which sections of this document to include in context.

This section exists to make handoff to zero-cost agents practical. Model choice is part of execution quality: pick the cheapest model that can still finish the task without inventing architecture, skipping tests, or drifting across service boundaries.

### Available free models

| Model | Access | Context window | Strengths | Monthly free limit |
|-------|--------|----------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **GPT-4o-mini** | GitHub Copilot Free tier (default) | 128K tokens | Fast, good at single-file edits, tests, small refactors, Q&A | 2,000 completions/month |
| **Claude Sonnet 4 (latest)** | GitHub Copilot Free tier (premium) | 200K tokens | Complex reasoning, multi-file changes, large context analysis, architecture decisions | 50 requests/month |
| **GitHub Models API** | `GITHUB_TOKEN` in Codespaces/Actions | Varies | Script-based automation, ALM agent tasks | Rate-limited (free) |

### Task → Model decision matrix

| Task type | Best model | Reason | Context sections to include |
|-----------|-----------|--------|----------------------------|
| Single file bug fix | GPT-4o-mini | Fast, low cost, sufficient for focused edits | 13 (relevant file only) + 17 |
| Add a new API endpoint | GPT-4o-mini | Follows existing patterns, one component at a time | 4 (relevant component) + 13 (relevant subsection) |
| Write unit tests | GPT-4o-mini | Pattern-based, reference existing tests | 11 + 13 (test files) |
| CSS/UI styling changes | GPT-4o-mini | Localized changes, theme tokens known | 4.3 or 4.4 (frontend section) |
| Fix environment/config issues | GPT-4o-mini | Lookup-based, reference env vars | 14 + 15 + 17 |
| Docker/compose changes | GPT-4o-mini | Focused, pattern-following | 5 + 15 |
| Multi-file refactor (2-5 files, same component) | GPT-4o-mini | If files are in the same component, mini handles it | 4 (component) + 13 (all affected files) |
| **Multi-component change** (CP + Gateway + Plant) | **Claude Sonnet 4 (latest)** | Needs to reason across service boundaries and communication flow | 4 + 5 + 6 + 13 (all affected) |
| **Architecture decision** | **Claude Sonnet 4 (latest)** | Requires deep understanding of trade-offs, constitutional compliance | 1-6 + 17 |
| **New feature spanning multiple services** | **Claude Sonnet 4 (latest)** | Cross-cutting concerns, needs full context | Full doc (fits in 200K) |
| **Debugging cross-service auth/JWT issues** | **Claude Sonnet 4 (latest)** | Must understand Gateway middleware stack, JWT flow, secret sync | 6 + 9 + 14 + 17 |
| **Terraform/GCP infrastructure changes** | **Claude Sonnet 4 (latest)** | Complex module dependencies, secret wiring, LB routing | 8 + 9 + 13 (terraform) |
| **Database migration + model change** | **Claude Sonnet 4 (latest)** | Must understand BaseEntity, constitutional validators, Alembic | 3 + 10 + 13 (models + DB) |
| **ALM workflow changes** | **Claude Sonnet 4 (latest)** | 2200+ line workflow, complex job chaining, concurrency | 7 + 13 (scripts + workflows) |
| **Constitutional validator changes** | **Claude Sonnet 4 (latest)** | Core design pattern, affects all entities | 3 + 13 (validators + models) |
| CI/CD pipeline tweaks | GPT-4o-mini | Usually single-file YAML edits | 7 + 8 |
| README/docs updates | GPT-4o-mini | Text editing, low complexity | Relevant section |
| Script automation | GitHub Models API | For ALM-triggered agent scripts | 7 + 13 (scripts) |

### Cost optimization rules

1. **Default to GPT-4o-mini** — it handles 85% of tasks at zero marginal cost
2. **Use Claude 3.5 Sonnet only when**: task touches 3+ files across 2+ components, OR requires architectural reasoning, OR involves the constitutional design pattern
3. **Never paste the full document into GPT-4o-mini** — only paste the sections listed in the "Context sections" column above
4. **Paste the full document into Claude Sonnet 4 (latest)** when doing cross-component work — it fits easily in 200K context
5. **Budget your 50 Claude requests/month**: ~2 per working day. Save them for complex tasks, use mini for everything else
6. **For repetitive similar tasks** (e.g., adding 5 similar endpoints): use Claude Sonnet 4 (latest) for the first one to establish the pattern, then GPT-4o-mini for the remaining 4

### How to use this guide (agent instruction)

When a user describes a task:

```
1. Classify the task using the decision matrix above
2. State: "Recommended model: [MODEL] because [REASON]"
3. State: "Include these context sections: [NUMBERS]"
4. If the task is ambiguous, default to GPT-4o-mini
5. If the user explicitly requests a different model, respect that
6. Track Claude usage — warn if approaching monthly limit
```

## 19. Agent Working Instructions — Epic & Story Execution

> **MANDATORY**: Every AI agent working on this codebase MUST follow these instructions when the user describes a feature, fix, or improvement.

### Zero-cost agent execution checklist

Use this checklist before starting any non-trivial task. If any row cannot be answered, pause and gather that context from the referenced section before editing code.

| Question | Read here | Required outcome |
|---|---|---|
| What service owns the change? | §5.3 + §13 | Exact backend/frontend/gateway/infra ownership is clear |
| Which routes and hops are involved? | §5.2 + §6 + §13 | The caller, proxy, gateway, and Plant target are named explicitly |
| Which files are the canonical edit points? | §13 | The task is reduced to a small, concrete file set |
| Which tests must pass? | §11 | Required unit/integration/UI checks are named before coding |
| Which config/secrets/deploy rules apply? | §§8, 9, 14, 19 | No environment logic is baked into code, Dockerfiles, or Terraform templates |
| How will the agent recover if blocked? | §§17, 21, 22, 25 | The fallback commands, gotchas, and context-recovery path are known |

### Complex-task handoff bundle

When delegating a complex task to a zero-cost agent, include all of the following in the prompt or linked plan:

| Required handoff element | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| User outcome in one sentence | Prevents the agent from optimizing for implementation detail instead of behavior |
| Explicit out-of-scope list | Stops gold-plating and opportunistic refactors |
| Exact file paths or file-index sections | Keeps the read set within a small context window |
| Route/data-flow statement | Prevents confusion across CP, PP, Gateway, Plant, Mobile, and Terraform |
| Test command list | Forces completion to include verification, not just code edits |
| Deployment or runtime constraints | Prevents image-promotion, secret, CORS, and port regressions |
| Demo persona and account | Forces the plan to name who will actually use the feature on demo |
| Demo runtime data to create | Forces the plan to name the exact DB/runtime state needed for the portal journey to exist |
| Live walkthrough steps on deployed URLs | Forces the plan to prove value in CP/PP/mobile after deploy, not just in local tests |
| Visible-value proof gate | Prevents long stories from being marked complete when the customer still cannot see or use anything |

### Customer-Visible MVP Translation Rules

Use these rules whenever the user asks for an MVP, sellable feature, portal journey, operator workflow, or any story that claims customer value.

| Rule | Mandatory requirement |
|---|---|
| **No invisible MVPs** | If the customer or operator cannot see the journey on the deployed portal, the story is NOT complete even if the code, tests, and routes exist. |
| **Demo actor must be named** | Every customer-visible story must name the exact demo persona, account, tenant/customer, and hired instance or runtime id that will be used to prove the journey. |
| **Demo data must be explicit** | Every customer-visible story must list the exact runtime data to create or seed: hire/subscription, brief/config, draft/deliverable, approval state, channel/integration state, and final status labels expected in UI. |
| **Walkthrough must be explicit** | Every customer-visible story must list the exact deployed URLs and the exact click path or API path to prove the journey after deploy. |
| **Proof must be observable** | Story acceptance criteria must include what the user should literally see: page, cards, labels, statuses, or actions. Avoid abstract wording like “workflow exists” or “surface is wired.” |
| **Release-closeout requires demo proof** | A release story cannot be marked complete until someone verifies the deployed journey end to end on demo/UAT and records pass/fail evidence. |
| **Data creation is part of implementation** | If the portal needs runtime rows to show value, creation of those rows is part of the story, not an optional follow-up. |

### Required Story Fields For Sellable Portal Work

Any epic, plan, or story that claims customer-visible portal value MUST include all of the following fields. A story missing any field below is incomplete by definition.

| Required field | What to write |
|---|---|
| `Demo actor` | Exact customer/operator identity used for validation |
| `Demo runtime records` | Exact rows/state to create: subscription, hired agent, skill config/brief, deliverable, approval, channel connection, publish state |
| `Portal proof path` | Exact deployed URL plus click-by-click validation path |
| `Visible success state` | Exact UI text/cards/statuses expected on success |
| `Failure/blocked state` | Exact UI text/cards/statuses expected when blocked |
| `Proof artifact` | Screenshot, recording, or explicit walkthrough log reference |

### Release Gate For Customer Value

Before marking any customer-visible MVP story or release-closeout story as complete, answer all five questions below with `yes`:

| Question | Required answer |
|---|---|
| Does demo/UAT have the runtime data required to render the promised journey? | yes |
| Can a real user persona execute the journey on deployed CP/PP/mobile URLs? | yes |
| Are the expected success labels/cards/actions visibly present? | yes |
| Are the expected blocked/error states visibly present and truthful? | yes |
| Is there proof recorded for the deployed walkthrough? | yes |

If any answer is `no`, the story is `Dev Complete` at best, not `customer-complete` and not `release-complete`.

### Step 1: Create Epic & Story Document

Before writing any code, **ask the user** to confirm the feature scope, then create a planning document.

**Document location**: `docs/<component>/iterations/<EPIC-ID>-<short-name>.md` (component = `CP`, `plant`, `mobile`, `PP`, or `infra`). Example: `docs/mobile/iterations/MOB-PARITY-2-mobile-full-parity.md`. This matches pm-planner agent output conventions.

**Document structure**:

```markdown
# Epic: <Title>

**Created**: <date>
**Branch**: <branch-name>
**Status**: In Progress

## Tracking Table

| # | Story | Status | Branch commit | Notes |
|---|-------|--------|---------------|-------|
| 1 | <story title> | 🔴 Not Started | — | — |
| 2 | <story title> | 🔴 Not Started | — | — |
| 3 | <story title> | 🔴 Not Started | — | — |

Status legend: 🔴 Not Started | 🟡 In Progress | 🔵 Dev Complete, Pending Testing | 🟢 Complete (tests pass)

## Story 1: <Title>
### Objective
<what this story achieves>
### Acceptance criteria
- [ ] <criterion 1>
- [ ] <criterion 2>
### Files to modify
- `<path>` — <what changes>
### Files to create
- `<path>` — <purpose>
### Test requirements
- **Unit**: Add to `<test suite path>` — test <what>
- **Integration**: Add to `<test suite path>` — test <what>
- **UI**: Add to `<test suite path>` — test <what>
### Dependencies
- Depends on: Story <N> (if any)
- Blocked by: <nothing / description>

## Story 2: <Title>
...
```

### Step 2: Execute stories sequentially

1. **Mark story as 🟡 In Progress** in the tracking table
2. Implement the code changes described in the story
3. Add test cases to the **correct test suite** (see Section 11 for locations)
4. After code + tests written (but before running tests): **mark as 🔵 Dev Complete, Pending Testing**
5. Run tests via Docker (see Section 11 — Docker-only, NO venv)
6. When all tests pass: **mark as 🟢 Complete**
7. Commit and push to branch
8. Move to next story

### Step 3: Status updates & git

After each story completion:
```bash
# Update the tracking table in the epic doc
# Stage, commit, push
git add .
git commit -m "<type>(<scope>): <story summary>"
git push origin <branch>
```

### Rules (non-negotiable)

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Ask first** | Always ask the user to confirm epic scope and stories before creating the doc |
| **Sequential execution** | Stories execute in order unless explicitly marked as independent |
| **Docker-only testing** | All tests run inside Docker containers or Codespace (devcontainer). **NO venv, virtualenv, or conda.** |
| **No auth changes** | Do NOT modify authentication architecture (JWT flow, OAuth, Gateway auth middleware, RBAC). If a story requires auth changes, flag it and ask user. |
| **No constitutional changes** | Do NOT modify BaseEntity 7-section schema or L0 constitutional rules without explicit user approval |
| **Objective alignment first** | Before execution, state whether the work advances DMA value, DMA enablement, Share Trader value, or Share Trader enablement. If it does none of these, challenge scope before coding. |
| **Test suite placement** | Tests go in the correct suite per Section 11. Do not create ad-hoc test files outside established paths. |
| **Status accuracy** | 🔵 = code done + tests written but not executed. 🟢 = tests pass. Never mark 🟢 without passing tests. |
| **Commit messages** | Follow conventional commits: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>` (see Section 7) |
| **Branch discipline** | Work on the feature branch, never commit directly to `main` |
| **Image promotion path** | **ONE Docker image per service, promoted unchanged demo → uat → prod.** Never bake env-specific values (DB URL, timeouts, tracing, log levels, feature flags) into images. All config comes from env vars, Secret Manager, or tfvars. See "Environment Configuration Rules" below. |

### Product-priority compliance gate

Before planning or executing substantial work, classify it against §1.1.

| Question | Required answer |
|---|---|
| Does this directly improve DMA customer value? | Say exactly how: content creation, approval, scheduling, publishing, or performance tuning |
| If not direct DMA, does it unblock DMA or Share Trader delivery? | Say what it enables at runtime, deployment, or customer workflow level |
| If neither applies, should this work be reduced, deferred, or rejected? | Default to yes |

Do not let generic portal polish, abstract architecture, or convenience refactors outrank DMA-first customer value unless they are a real blocker to deployability, promotion, security, or runtime correctness.
| **Customer-visible proof** | For any sellable portal feature, do NOT mark the story complete unless the deployed CP/PP/mobile journey is visible with real demo/UAT runtime data and a recorded walkthrough. |

### Environment Configuration Rules (Image Promotion Path)

> **CRITICAL**: We follow the **12-factor app** principle. A single Docker image is built once and promoted unchanged through all environments. Environment-specific behavior is controlled EXTERNALLY.

#### What MUST be external (env vars / Secret Manager / tfvars)

| Category | Examples | Where it's injected |
|----------|----------|--------------------|
| **Database** | `DATABASE_URL`, connection pool size, SSL mode | Cloud Run env vars / Secret Manager |
| **Timeouts** | Request timeout, DB query timeout, retry intervals | Cloud Run env vars |
| **Tracing / Observability** | `OTEL_EXPORTER_ENDPOINT`, trace sample rate, `ENABLE_TRACING` | Cloud Run env vars |
| **Logging** | `LOG_LEVEL` (DEBUG/INFO/WARNING), `LOG_FORMAT` (json/text), verbose mode | Cloud Run env vars |
| **Feature flags** | `ENABLE_2FA`, `ENABLE_AUDIT_LOG`, `MAINTENANCE_MODE` | Cloud Run env vars |
| **Secrets** | `JWT_SECRET`, `CP_REGISTRATION_KEY`, API keys, OAuth credentials | GCP Secret Manager |
| **Service URLs** | `PLANT_GATEWAY_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, inter-service endpoints | Cloud Run env vars / tfvars |
| **Scaling** | Min/max instances, CPU, memory | Terraform tfvars (`cloud/terraform/environments/{env}.tfvars`) |
| **Domain / CORS** | `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, domain mappings | Terraform tfvars |

#### What is ALLOWED in the Docker image

| Allowed | Example |
|---------|--------|
| Application code | Python source, compiled frontend assets |
| Default config values | Sensible defaults that get overridden by env vars |
| Static assets | CSS, JS bundles, images |
| Dependencies | `requirements.txt`, `node_modules` |

#### Terraform Template Anti-Patterns (BANNED)

These patterns bake environment knowledge into the terraform template, violating the image promotion rule. They are rejected on code review.

```hcl
# ❌ BANNED: ternary with hardcoded fallback value
PAYMENTS_MODE = var.payments_mode != "" ? var.payments_mode : "razorpay"

# ❌ BANNED: env-conditional logic in template (found in CP terraform, fixed PR #851)
OTP_DELIVERY_MODE = var.otp_delivery_mode != "" ? var.otp_delivery_mode : (var.environment == "demo" ? "disabled" : "provider")

# ✅ CORRECT: clean passthrough — defaults live in variables.tf
PAYMENTS_MODE     = var.payments_mode     # variables.tf: default = "razorpay"
OTP_DELIVERY_MODE = var.otp_delivery_mode # variables.tf: default = "provider"
```

The template is a passthrough. `variables.tf` holds safe defaults. `environments/{env}.tfvars` overrides per environment. Sensitive values (API keys, JWT secrets, DB URLs) go in `secrets {}` sourced from GCP Secret Manager — never in `env_vars {}`.

**Quick rule**: if you write `var.environment` anywhere inside `env_vars = {}`, stop — you are baking environment logic into the template.
| Health check endpoints | `/health`, `/ready` |

#### ❌ NEVER do this

```dockerfile
# ❌ WRONG — hardcoding env-specific values in Dockerfile
ENV DATABASE_URL=postgresql://waooaw:pass@demo-db:5432/waooaw_db
ENV LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
ENV PLANT_GATEWAY_URL=https://gateway-demo.waooaw.com
```

```python
# ❌ WRONG — hardcoding env-specific values in source code
DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://waooaw:pass@demo-db:5432/waooaw_db"
TIMEOUT = 30 if environment == "prod" else 5  # Don't branch on env name
```

#### ✅ DO this instead

```python
# ✅ CORRECT — read from environment with sensible defaults
import os

DATABASE_URL = os.environ["DATABASE_URL"]  # Required — fail fast if missing
LOG_LEVEL = os.environ.get("LOG_LEVEL", "INFO")  # Optional with default
REQUEST_TIMEOUT = int(os.environ.get("REQUEST_TIMEOUT", "30"))  # Default 30s
ENABLE_TRACING = os.environ.get("ENABLE_TRACING", "false").lower() == "true"
```

```hcl
# ✅ CORRECT — environment-specific values in tfvars
# cloud/terraform/environments/demo.tfvars
log_level       = "DEBUG"
request_timeout = 5
enable_tracing  = true
min_instances   = 0

# cloud/terraform/environments/prod.tfvars
log_level       = "WARNING"
request_timeout = 30
enable_tracing  = true
min_instances   = 2
```

#### Image promotion flow

```
Build (CI)          Deploy (CD)
─────────           ──────────────────────────────────────
                    ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐

                    └─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

> **Agent checkpoint**: Before committing any change, verify: *"Would this change behave differently if the same Docker image were deployed to demo vs prod?"* If yes → the config MUST be externalized.

### Secret inventory

| Secret | GitHub Secret name | GCP Secret name | Used by | Sync critical? |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|---------|----------------|
| JWT signing key | `JWT_SECRET` | `JWT_SECRET` | CP, PP, Plant, Gateway | **YES** — mismatch = silent 401s |
| Google OAuth ID | `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | CP, PP, Gateway | YES |
| Google OAuth secret | `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Gateway | YES |
| GCP Service Account | `GCP_SA_KEY` | (IAM, not SM) | CI/CD workflows | — |
| CP ↔ Gateway shared key | `CP_REGISTRATION_KEY` | `CP_REGISTRATION_KEY` | CP Backend, Gateway | YES |
| Turnstile public key | `TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` | (frontend build arg) | CP Frontend | NO (public) |
| Turnstile server key | `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` | `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` | CP Backend | YES |
| Platform connection credentials | (runtime-written) | `hired-{hired_instance_id}-{platform_key}` | CP Backend (write), Plant Backend (read via `secret_ref`) | NO — different secret per connection; written at POST time by `GcpSecretManagerAdapter` |

#### Mobile Build Secrets (EAS + GitHub Actions)

> Full details in §23 (“Secrets — GitHub Secrets vs EAS Secrets”). Listed here for completeness so §20 remains a complete secret inventory.

| Secret | GitHub Secret name | Used by | Sync critical? |
|--------|-------------------|---------|---------------|
| Expo access token | `EXPO_TOKEN` | `mobile-playstore-deploy.yml` | YES — EAS CLI auth |
| Play Store SA key | `GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` | `mobile-playstore-deploy.yml` | YES — Play Store submission |
| Android OAuth client | `EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID_DEMO` | EAS build (demo) | YES |
| Web OAuth client | `EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID_DEMO` | EAS build (demo) | YES |
| Plant API URL | `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL_DEMO` | EAS build (demo) | YES |
| OAuth redirect scheme | `EXPO_PUBLIC_OAUTH_REDIRECT_SCHEME_DEMO` | EAS build (demo) | YES |

### How to update a secret

```bash
# 1. Update in GitHub (via UI or CLI)
gh secret set JWT_SECRET --body "new-value-here"

# 2. Update in GCP Secret Manager
gcloud secrets versions add JWT_SECRET --data-file=- <<< "new-value-here"

# 3. Redeploy affected services (secret change requires new revision)
# Via workflow: GitHub Actions → WAOOAW Deploy → select environment → apply
# Or manually:
gcloud run services update waooaw-api-demo --region asia-south1 --update-secrets=JWT_SECRET=JWT_SECRET:latest
```

### Local development secrets

| File | Purpose | Git-tracked? |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `.env` | Local overrides (developer-specific) | **NO** (in .gitignore) |
| `.env.example` | Template with placeholder values | YES |
| `.env.docker` | Docker Compose specific | **NO** |
| `.env.gateway` | Gateway specific | **NO** |
| `docker-compose.local.yml` | Has default dev values (non-sensitive) | YES |

### GCP CLI commands

#### GCP authentication in Codespace — ALREADY CONFIGURED

> **GCP auth is permanent.** The `waooaw-codespace-reader` SA activates automatically on every Codespace start via `.devcontainer/gcp-auth.sh`.

```bash
# --- Verify auth (run first, should always show ACTIVE) ---
gcloud auth list
# Expected: waooaw-codespace-reader@waooaw-oauth.iam.gserviceaccount.com  ACTIVE

# --- If not active (e.g. after manual gcloud logout) ---
bash /workspaces/WAOOAW/.devcontainer/gcp-auth.sh

# --- What the script does on each boot ---
# 1. Reads GCP_SA_KEY Codespace secret → /root/.gcp/waooaw-sa.json
# 2. gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=/root/.gcp/waooaw-sa.json
# 3. gcloud config set project waooaw-oauth
# 4. Starts cloud-sql-proxy on 127.0.0.1:15432 (→ plant-sql-demo)
# 5. Reads demo-plant-database-url from Secret Manager
# 6. Writes /root/.pgpass + /root/.env.db for passwordless psql
```

> **SA**: `waooaw-codespace-reader@waooaw-oauth.iam.gserviceaccount.com`  
> **Roles**: `logging.viewer`, `run.viewer`, `cloudsql.admin`, `cloudsql.client`, `secretmanager.viewer`, `secretmanager.secretAccessor`  
> **Scope**: read-only on logs/services, full read on secrets, admin on Cloud SQL

#### Cloud Run service names (exact lookup table)

| Component | Service name pattern | demo | uat | prod |
|-----------|---------------------|------|-----|------|
| CP Frontend | `waooaw-cp-frontend-{env}` | `waooaw-cp-frontend-demo` | `waooaw-cp-frontend-uat` | `waooaw-cp-frontend-prod` |
| CP Backend | `waooaw-cp-backend-{env}` | `waooaw-cp-backend-demo` | `waooaw-cp-backend-uat` | `waooaw-cp-backend-prod` |
| PP Frontend | `waooaw-pp-frontend-{env}` | `waooaw-pp-frontend-demo` | `waooaw-pp-frontend-uat` | `waooaw-pp-frontend-prod` |
| PP Backend | `waooaw-pp-backend-{env}` | `waooaw-pp-backend-demo` | `waooaw-pp-backend-uat` | `waooaw-pp-backend-prod` |
| Plant Backend | `waooaw-plant-backend-{env}` | `waooaw-plant-backend-demo` | `waooaw-plant-backend-uat` | `waooaw-plant-backend-prod` |
| Plant Gateway | `waooaw-plant-gateway-{env}` | `waooaw-plant-gateway-demo` | `waooaw-plant-gateway-uat` | `waooaw-plant-gateway-prod` |
| Gateway (CP) | `waooaw-gateway-cp-{env}` | `waooaw-gateway-cp-demo` | `waooaw-gateway-cp-uat` | `waooaw-gateway-cp-prod` |
| Gateway (PP) | `waooaw-gateway-pp-{env}` | `waooaw-gateway-pp-demo` | `waooaw-gateway-pp-uat` | `waooaw-gateway-pp-prod` |

> **Currently deployed**: Only CP services (`enable_cp=true`) are active in all environments. PP and Plant are `enable_pp=false`, `enable_plant=false`.

#### GCP project & region constants

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Project ID | `waooaw-oauth` |
| Region | `asia-south1` |
| Artifact Registry | `asia-south1-docker.pkg.dev/waooaw-oauth/waooaw/` |

#### Ready-to-use log commands

Replace `{SERVICE}` with a service name from the table above (e.g., `waooaw-cp-backend-demo`):

```bash
# --- Authentication — SA is pre-configured in Codespace ---
# DO NOT run 'gcloud auth login' — it overwrites the SA context with your personal Google account.
# Instead, re-run the auth script if the SA shows as inactive:
bash /workspaces/WAOOAW/.devcontainer/gcp-auth.sh
gcloud auth list  # should show waooaw-codespace-reader\@waooaw-oauth.iam.gserviceaccount.com ACTIVE

# --- Secrets ---
gcloud secrets list                                         # List all secrets
gcloud secrets versions access latest --secret=JWT_SECRET   # Read a secret value
gcloud secrets versions add JWT_SECRET --data-file=- <<< "new-value"  # Update secret

# --- List all Cloud Run services ---
gcloud run services list --region=asia-south1

# --- Describe a specific service ---
gcloud run services describe {SERVICE} --region=asia-south1

# --- Live logs (last 10 minutes, 50 entries) ---
gcloud logging read \
  'resource.type="cloud_run_revision" AND resource.labels.service_name="{SERVICE}"' \
  --limit=50 --format=json --freshness=10m

# --- Error logs only ---
gcloud logging read \
  'resource.type="cloud_run_revision" AND severity>=ERROR AND resource.labels.service_name="{SERVICE}"' \
  --limit=20 --format="table(timestamp,textPayload)"

# --- Example: CP Backend demo errors ---
gcloud logging read \
  'resource.type="cloud_run_revision" AND severity>=ERROR AND resource.labels.service_name="waooaw-cp-backend-demo"' \
  --limit=20 --format="table(timestamp,textPayload)"

# --- Example: Plant Gateway demo logs ---
gcloud logging read \
  'resource.type="cloud_run_revision" AND resource.labels.service_name="waooaw-plant-gateway-demo"' \
  --limit=50 --format=json --freshness=10m

# --- Cloud SQL ---
gcloud sql instances list                                   # List DB instances
gcloud sql instances describe plant-sql-demo --format="value(ipAddresses)"  # Check IPs
gcloud sql instances patch plant-sql-demo --assign-ip --quiet  # Enable public IP (SA has cloudsql.admin)
gcloud sql operations list --instance=plant-sql-demo --filter="status!=DONE"  # Check running ops

# --- Connect to demo DB (proxy auto-started, just run psql) ---
source /root/.env.db && psql                               # Recommended
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 15432 -U plant_app plant             # Direct

# --- Proxy management ---
cat /tmp/cloud-sql-proxy.log                               # Check proxy status
pgrep -fa cloud-sql-proxy                                  # Confirm proxy PID
bash /workspaces/WAOOAW/.devcontainer/gcp-auth.sh          # Restart if needed

# --- Artifact Registry ---
gcloud artifacts docker images list asia-south1-docker.pkg.dev/waooaw-oauth/waooaw  # List images
gcloud artifacts docker tags list asia-south1-docker.pkg.dev/waooaw-oauth/waooaw/cp-backend  # Image tags

# --- Terraform state ---
cd cloud/terraform
terraform state list                                        # List managed resources
terraform state show module.customer_portal[0]               # Inspect a resource
terraform plan -var-file=environments/demo.tfvars            # Plan changes
```

### Debugging cheat sheet

| Scenario | Command |
|----------|---------|
| App won't start locally | `docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml logs plant-backend --tail=50` |
| 401 errors across services | Check JWT_SECRET matches: `echo $JWT_SECRET` in each container |
| CP can't reach Gateway | `docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml exec cp-backend curl http://plant-gateway:8000/health` |
| DB connection failing | `docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml exec db pg_isready -U waooaw` |
| Check running containers | `docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml ps` |
| GCP service unhealthy | `gcloud run services describe <service> --region=asia-south1 --format='get(status.conditions)'` |
| GCP deployment failed | `gcloud logging read 'resource.type="cloud_run_revision" AND severity>=ERROR' --limit=10 --freshness=30m` |
| Secret not reaching container | `gcloud run services describe <service> --region=asia-south1 --format='yaml(spec.template.spec.containers[0].env)'` |
| Port already in use | `lsof -i :<port>` or `docker ps --filter publish=<port>` |
| Redis connectivity | `docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml exec redis redis-cli ping` |

### Runtime Validation Playbook — verified on demo (9 Mar 2026)

Use this when validating `PLANT-RUNTIME-1` or any CP FrontEnd -> CP BackEnd -> Plant runtime contract.

#### 1. Validate in this order

| Step | Root cause avoided | Impact if skipped | Best possible solution/fix |
|------|--------------------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| 1. Plant Gateway public route | CP proxy can hide upstream route drift behind nested 404s | You misclassify a Plant defect as a CP defect | Probe `waooaw-plant-gateway-{env}` first for the canonical Plant path |
| 2. CP Backend proxy route | CP proxy may still target stale upstream paths | You miss thin-proxy breakage even when Plant is healthy | Probe `waooaw-cp-backend-{env}` second with the same business identifier |
| 3. CP FrontEnd service file | Frontend may still call an outdated CP route | You blame backend only and miss the actual caller | Confirm the exact frontend service path before classifying the defect |
| 4. Live DB row shape | Demo data mixes UUID-backed and external-id-backed records | False negatives from invalid identifiers | Pull one real row from Cloud SQL before testing non-list endpoints |

#### 2. Use the correct public surface

| Surface | Use for | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| `waooaw-plant-gateway-{env}` | Public validation of Plant customer-facing runtime routes | Preferred first hop for deployed runtime validation |
| `waooaw-cp-backend-{env}` | CP proxy validation (`/api/cp/*`, `/api/auth/*`) | Use after Plant Gateway so you can separate proxy drift from upstream drift |
| `waooaw-plant-backend-{env}` | Logs, revision inspection, service metadata | Direct HTTP access is Cloud Run IAM-protected; do not expect anonymous curl from Codespace to work |

#### 3. Cloud SQL proxy gotchas that were verified live

| Root cause | Impact | Best possible solution/fix |
|------------|--------|----------------------------|
| `gcp-auth.sh` completed but Cloud SQL proxy could not attach because the instance had no `PUBLIC` IP | `psql` hangs or fails even though auth setup appears complete | Check `/tmp/cloud-sql-proxy.log`; if it says `instance does not have IP of type PUBLIC`, run `gcloud sql instances patch plant-sql-demo --assign-ip --project=waooaw-oauth --quiet`, wait for the operation to finish, then rerun `bash /workspaces/WAOOAW/.devcontainer/gcp-auth.sh` |
| Proxy process exists but tunnel is stale | Ad hoc SQL checks return misleading connection failures | `pgrep -fa cloud-sql-proxy`, `cat /tmp/cloud-sql-proxy.log`, then restart the auth script |
| Assuming docs imply direct DB connectivity on `5432` | Wasted time debugging the wrong socket | Always use `source /root/.env.db && psql` or `psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 15432 -U plant_app plant` |

#### 4. Schema assumptions that caused false starts

Inspect `information_schema.columns` before writing ad hoc queries. Demo schema contains these verified shapes:

| Table | Verified column(s) to use | Do not assume |
|-------|---------------------------|---------------|
| `customer_entity` | `id`, `email`, `full_name`, `business_name` | `customer_id` does not exist in this table |
| `hired_agents` | `hired_instance_id`, `agent_id`, `customer_id`, `active`, `configured`, `goals_completed` | A generic `status` column |
| `agent_skills` | `agent_id`, `skill_id`, `goal_config` | Skill config lives only in a separate logical surface |
| `skill_configs` | `hired_instance_id`, `skill_id`, `customer_fields`, `pp_locked_fields` | Free-form names without checking the table first |

#### 5. Identifier discipline for live probes

| Root cause | Impact | Best possible solution/fix |
|------------|--------|----------------------------|
| Mixing external ids like `AGT-MKT-001` with UUID-backed routes | `422 Invalid UUID` can look like a route defect | Query the live row first and probe with the exact identifier type stored in the route contract |
| Demo hired agents are mixed: some point to UUID `agent_id`, others to external ids | One sample works, another fails for unrelated reasons | Treat every probe id as data-dependent until confirmed in SQL |
| Assuming a hired-agent route is equivalent to an agent route | False confidence because legacy `/api/v1/agents/{agent_id}/skills` still exists | Test the canonical hired-agent route separately; legacy agent routes do not prove Iteration 1 is deployed |

#### 6. CP request-chain tracing entry points

Start here when a CP UI flow fails and you need the exact hop sequence.

| Surface | First file to inspect | What it controls |
|---------|-----------------------|------------------|
| CP FrontEnd hired-agent skills | `src/CP/FrontEnd/src/services/agentSkills.service.ts` | `/api/cp/hired-agents/{id}/skills` and goal-config save calls |
| CP FrontEnd platform connections | `src/CP/FrontEnd/src/services/platformConnections.service.ts` | Hired-agent platform-connection calls |
| CP BackEnd hired-agent skills proxy | `src/CP/BackEnd/api/cp_skills.py` | CP -> Plant translation for hired-agent skills and goal-config |
| CP BackEnd flow/component runs proxy | `src/CP/BackEnd/api/cp_flow_runs.py` | CP -> Plant flow-runs and component-runs targets |
| CP BackEnd scheduler proxy | `src/CP/BackEnd/api/cp_scheduler.py` | Trial budget, scheduler summary, pause/resume |
| CP BackEnd approvals proxy | `src/CP/BackEnd/api/cp_approvals_proxy.py` | Approval queue, approve, reject |

#### 7. Known runtime drift patterns observed on demo

These are environment findings, not normative architecture. Re-check before acting on them.

| Root cause | Impact | Best possible solution/fix |
|------------|--------|----------------------------|
| Plant Gateway exposes legacy `/api/v1/agents/{agent_id}/skills` but not canonical hired-agent skills route | Iteration 1 hired-agent skill surface fails even though a nearby legacy route still works | Deploy the hired-agent route from `PLANT-RUNTIME-1` and do not treat the legacy agent route as equivalent |
| Plant Gateway does not expose `/api/v1/hired-agents/by-id/{id}`, `/api/v1/skill-runs`, or `/api/v1/component-runs` on demo | Iteration 2 CP proxy routes fail with nested upstream 404s | Deploy the normalized Plant runtime surface before debugging CP behavior |
| Some route inventories still include malformed paths like `/api/v1/v1/...` | Proxy construction bugs are harder to spot during manual validation | Inspect OpenAPI and route inventories for duplicated version prefixes whenever route-not-found responses look inconsistent |

#### 8. Auth guidance for runtime validation

| Use case | Recommended method |
|----------|--------------------|
| Plant Gateway customer-route validation | Mint a short-lived customer access JWT from `JWT_SECRET` and call the gateway directly |
| CP proxy validation | Prefer a real CP session or a known-good refresh token captured from the deployed flow; do not assume an ad hoc signed refresh token will always satisfy CP refresh semantics |
| Direct Plant Backend validation | Use logs/OpenAPI/service metadata unless you also have Cloud Run IAM invocation rights |

## 22. Troubleshooting FAQ — Agent Self-Service Reference

> **INSTRUCTION TO AI AGENT**: Before asking the user ANY question about credentials, service names, environments, or debugging — **read this section first**. Every common question is pre-answered below.

---

### Q1: "I need GCP credentials to run log commands"

**Answer**: GCP auth is **permanently configured** in this Codespace via the `waooaw-codespace-reader` SA. You should be able to run `gcloud` commands immediately.

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Normal case | `gcloud auth list` shows `waooaw-codespace-reader@waooaw-oauth.iam.gserviceaccount.com ACTIVE` — proceed directly |
| Auth missing (e.g. after container rebuild before `GCP_SA_KEY` secret propagates) | Run `bash /workspaces/WAOOAW/.devcontainer/gcp-auth.sh` |
| SA not authorized for an action | Check SA roles in Section 9. If missing a role, ask user to grant it from Cloud Shell. |
| Need DB access | Cloud SQL Proxy auto-starts on port 15432. Run `source /root/.env.db && psql` — no further setup needed. |

**Quick auth check script:**
```bash
# Run this FIRST before any gcloud command
if gcloud auth list 2>/dev/null | grep -q ACTIVE; then
  echo "✅ GCP auth active — $(gcloud config get-value account 2>/dev/null)"
else
  echo "⚠️ Re-running auth setup..."
  bash /workspaces/WAOOAW/.devcontainer/gcp-auth.sh
fi
```

---

### Q2: "I need the exact Cloud Run service name"

**Answer**: Use this lookup table. The naming pattern is `waooaw-{component}-{role}-{environment}`.

| Component | Role | demo | uat | prod |
|-----------|------|------|-----|------|
| CP | frontend | `waooaw-cp-frontend-demo` | `waooaw-cp-frontend-uat` | `waooaw-cp-frontend-prod` |
| CP | backend | `waooaw-cp-backend-demo` | `waooaw-cp-backend-uat` | `waooaw-cp-backend-prod` |
| PP | frontend | `waooaw-pp-frontend-demo` | `waooaw-pp-frontend-uat` | `waooaw-pp-frontend-prod` |
| PP | backend | `waooaw-pp-backend-demo` | `waooaw-pp-backend-uat` | `waooaw-pp-backend-prod` |
| Plant | backend | `waooaw-plant-backend-demo` | `waooaw-plant-backend-uat` | `waooaw-plant-backend-prod` |
| Plant | gateway | `waooaw-plant-gateway-demo` | `waooaw-plant-gateway-uat` | `waooaw-plant-gateway-prod` |
| Gateway | cp | `waooaw-gateway-cp-demo` | `waooaw-gateway-cp-uat` | `waooaw-gateway-cp-prod` |
| Gateway | pp | `waooaw-gateway-pp-demo` | `waooaw-gateway-pp-uat` | `waooaw-gateway-pp-prod` |

> **Currently deployed (as of Feb 2026)**: Only **CP** services are active (`enable_cp=true`). PP and Plant have `enable_pp=false`, `enable_plant=false` in all environments.

**How to pick the right service:**

| You're debugging… | Service to query |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Customer registration / login / OTP | `waooaw-cp-backend-{env}` |
| Customer portal UI not loading | `waooaw-cp-frontend-{env}` |
| API proxy / auth / JWT errors | `waooaw-gateway-cp-{env}` or `waooaw-plant-gateway-{env}` |
| Agent CRUD / industry / skill data | `waooaw-plant-backend-{env}` |
| Platform portal (admin) UI | `waooaw-pp-frontend-{env}` |
| Platform portal API | `waooaw-pp-backend-{env}` |

---

### Q3: "Which environment and region should I use?"

**Answer**:

| Setting | Value | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| **GCP Project** | `waooaw-oauth` | Always this — single project for all envs |
| **Region** | `asia-south1` | All Cloud Run, Cloud SQL, and Artifact Registry resources |
| **Default environment** | `demo` | Unless user specifies otherwise, assume `demo` |
| **Environments available** | `demo`, `uat`, `prod` | Terraform tfvars: `cloud/terraform/environments/{env}.tfvars` |

**Rule of thumb**: If the user says "check logs" without specifying environment → use **demo**. If they say "production issue" → use **prod**.

---

### Q4: "What time window should I search for logs?"

**Answer**: Use these defaults if the user doesn't specify:

| User says | `--freshness` value | Command snippet |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| "just happened" / "right now" | `5m` | `--freshness=5m` |
| "recent" / "just tried" | `30m` | `--freshness=30m` |
| "today" / "this morning" | `6h` | `--freshness=6h` |
| "yesterday" | `24h` | `--freshness=24h` |
| Specific time given | Use timestamp filter | `timestamp>="2026-02-17T10:00:00Z"` |
| No time mentioned at all | `1h` | `--freshness=1h` (safe default) |

**Complete log command template (copy-paste ready):**
```bash
# Replace {SERVICE} and {FRESHNESS} — defaults: waooaw-cp-backend-demo, 1h
gcloud logging read \
  'resource.type="cloud_run_revision" AND resource.labels.service_name="{SERVICE}"' \
  --project=waooaw-oauth \
  --limit=50 \
  --format="table(timestamp,severity,textPayload)" \
  --freshness={FRESHNESS}
```

---

### Q5: "Registration failed — how do I debug it?"

**Answer**: CP registration flows through 3 services. Check in this order:

| Step | Service | What to look for |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| 1. Frontend | `waooaw-cp-frontend-{env}` | JS console errors, failed API calls (open browser DevTools → Network tab) |
| 2. CP Backend | `waooaw-cp-backend-{env}` | `/register` endpoint errors, OTP validation failures, GSTIN/phone validation |
| 3. Plant Gateway | `waooaw-plant-gateway-{env}` | Customer creation via CP_REGISTRATION_KEY auth, DB write errors |

**Quick debug commands (demo env):**
```bash
# Step 1: Check CP Backend for registration errors
gcloud logging read \
  'resource.type="cloud_run_revision" AND resource.labels.service_name="waooaw-cp-backend-demo" AND severity>=ERROR' \
  --project=waooaw-oauth --limit=20 --freshness=1h \
  --format="table(timestamp,textPayload)"

# Step 2: Check Plant Gateway for downstream errors
gcloud logging read \
  'resource.type="cloud_run_revision" AND resource.labels.service_name="waooaw-plant-gateway-demo" AND severity>=ERROR' \
  --project=waooaw-oauth --limit=20 --freshness=1h \
  --format="table(timestamp,textPayload)"

# Step 3: Check if it's a secret mismatch
# CP_REGISTRATION_KEY must match in both CP Backend AND Plant Gateway
gcloud secrets versions access latest --secret=CP_REGISTRATION_KEY
```

---

### Q6: "JWT / 401 Unauthorized errors across services"

**Answer**: Almost always a **JWT_SECRET mismatch**.

| Check | Command |
|-------|---------|
| Verify JWT_SECRET is set | `gcloud secrets versions access latest --secret=JWT_SECRET` |
| Verify all services use same secret | All 4 components (CP, PP, Plant, Gateway) must reference the same `JWT_SECRET` in Secret Manager |
| Check Gateway middleware logs | Query `waooaw-gateway-cp-{env}` or `waooaw-plant-gateway-{env}` for auth errors |
| Local Docker JWT issue | Ensure `JWT_SECRET` in `docker-compose.local.yml` matches across all services |

**Local Docker fix:**
```bash
# Check if JWT_SECRET is consistent across services in docker-compose
grep -n "JWT_SECRET" docker-compose.local.yml
```

---

### Q7: "Docker containers won't start / database connection errors"

**Answer**:

```bash
# Check which containers are running
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml ps

# Check container logs for errors
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml logs --tail=50 plant-backend
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml logs --tail=50 cp-backend

# Restart everything cleanly
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml down -v
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up --build -d

# Check if DB is accepting connections
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml exec db pg_isready -U waooaw

# Check if Redis is up
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml exec redis redis-cli ping
```

| Common error | Root cause | Fix |
|-------------|------------|-----|
| `connection refused port 5432` | DB not ready yet | Wait 10s or restart compose |
| `role "waooaw" does not exist` | DB not initialized | `docker compose down -v && docker compose up --build -d` |
| `FATAL: password authentication failed` | Wrong POSTGRES_PASSWORD | Check `docker-compose.local.yml` env vars |
| `redis.exceptions.ConnectionError` | Redis not started | `docker compose up -d redis` |

---

### Q8: "How do I run tests?"

**Answer**: **Docker only. Never use venv.**

```bash
# Run all tests for a component
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml run --rm plant-backend pytest -x -v

# Run specific test file
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml run --rm cp-backend pytest tests/test_registration.py -v

# Run with coverage
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml run --rm plant-backend pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html

# Run frontend tests
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml run --rm cp-frontend npm test
```

> See **Section 11** for full test strategy and file locations.

---

### Q9: "How do I check what's deployed vs what's in code?"

**Answer**:

```bash
# What's deployed to Cloud Run (requires GCP auth)
gcloud run services describe waooaw-cp-backend-demo --region=asia-south1 \
  --format="value(status.latestReadyRevisionName)"

# What's the latest image in Artifact Registry
gcloud artifacts docker tags list \
  asia-south1-docker.pkg.dev/waooaw-oauth/waooaw/cp-backend --limit=5

# What's merged to main
git --no-pager log --oneline origin/main -10

# What's different between your branch and main
git --no-pager diff --stat origin/main

# Last GitHub Actions deploy
gh run list --workflow=waooaw-deploy.yml --limit=5
```

### Q10: "I need to check/update a database table"

**Answer**:

| Method | How |
|--------|-----|
| **Local (Docker)** | `docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml exec db psql -U waooaw -d waooaw_db` |
| **GCP Cloud SQL (Codespace)** | `source /root/.env.db && psql` — Cloud SQL Auth Proxy on port 15432 (started by `gcp-auth.sh`); see §10 first-attempt checklist |
| **Adminer UI (local)** | `http://localhost:8081` — server: `db`, user: `waooaw`, db: `waooaw_db` |

**Common queries:**
```sql
-- Check recent customers
SELECT id, email, company_name, created_at FROM customers ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Check migration status
SELECT version_num FROM alembic_version;

-- Check agent data
SELECT id, name, industry, status FROM agents LIMIT 20;
```

## 23. Mobile Application — CP Mobile

> **Live reference set in this branch**: `src/mobile/package.json`, `src/mobile/src/navigation/MainNavigator.tsx`, `src/mobile/src/config/api.config.ts`, `src/mobile/src/services/`, `src/mobile/src/screens/`  
> **Current status**: Active React Native / Expo app with direct Plant Gateway usage for most runtime flows.  
> **Current focus**: `demo` environment unless the task explicitly needs `uat` or `prod`.  
> **Last updated**: 2026-04-15

### Overview

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **App** | WAOOAW CP Mobile — customer-facing marketplace for browsing, hiring, and managing AI agents |
| **Platform** | React Native (Expo Managed Workflow) |
| **Targets** | Android (API 31+, Android 12+); iOS (iOS 15+) — iOS build pending |
| **Package** | `com.waooaw.app` |
| **EAS account** | `waooaw` (https://expo.dev/accounts/waooaw) |
| **EAS project ID** | `fdb3bbde-a0e0-43f9-bf55-e780ecc563e7` |
| **Source path** | `src/mobile/` |
| **Primary entrypoints** | `src/mobile/package.json`, `src/mobile/src/navigation/MainNavigator.tsx`, `src/mobile/src/config/api.config.ts` |

---

### Mobile Fast-Path Files

Historical mobile iteration docs are gone in this branch. Start with the live source files below instead of searching `docs/mobile/`.

| Need | First file | Then inspect | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| App entry and commands | `src/mobile/package.json` | `src/mobile/app.json`, `src/mobile/eas.json` | Confirms Expo scripts, test commands, and build targets |
| Screen map / navigation | `src/mobile/src/navigation/MainNavigator.tsx` | `src/mobile/src/navigation/types.ts`, `src/mobile/src/screens/` | Shows the current tabs, stacks, and routed surfaces |
| API base URL and environment wiring | `src/mobile/src/config/api.config.ts` | `src/mobile/src/config/environment.config.ts`, `src/mobile/src/lib/cpApiClient.ts` | First place to debug wrong backend targets or environment drift |
| Auth and session recovery | `src/mobile/src/services/auth.service.ts` | `src/mobile/src/store/authStore.ts`, `src/mobile/src/screens/auth/` | Canonical mobile sign-in, OTP, and token handling path |
| Hired-agent operations | `src/mobile/src/screens/agents/AgentOperationsScreen.tsx` | `src/mobile/src/services/hiredAgents/hiredAgents.service.ts`, `src/mobile/src/components/ContentDraftApprovalCard.tsx` | Best entry into approvals, operations, and customer action surfaces |
| Push notifications | `src/mobile/src/services/notifications/pushNotifications.service.ts` | `src/mobile/src/config/sentry.config.ts`, `src/mobile/src/services/monitoring/` | Covers device registration, alerts, and runtime signal capture |

> **Testing rule (mobile)**: All tests are executed in Docker/Codespace (no local venv/virtualenv assumption for backend parity). Mobile unit tests run via `cd src/mobile && npm test` in the devcontainer environment.
>
> **Release-readiness test lane (2026-04-15)**: Fast mobile smoke = `cd src/mobile && npm run typecheck && npm test -- --runTestsByPath src/screens/agents/__tests__/MyAgentsScreen.test.tsx __tests__/NotificationsScreen.test.tsx --maxWorkers=2`. Full coverage expanded to 50+ suites / 509+ tests after MOB-PARITY-1 (PR #1060) added 12 new Jest tests for Inbox, ContentAnalytics, PlatformConnections, UsageBilling, voice overlay, billing services, content analytics service, platform connections service, navigation, and hooks.

---

### Architecture Role

The mobile app is a **CP-equivalent client** — it talks directly to the **Plant Gateway** (port 8000), the same as CP Backend does. It does **not** go through CP Backend.

```
Mobile App
  → Plant Gateway (/:8000) [JWT auth, RBAC, policy]
    → Plant Backend (:8001) [business logic, DB]
```

This means the mobile API base URL is the Plant Gateway URL, not the CP backend URL (`cp.*.waooaw.com`).

---

### Registration & OTP (Mobile vs CP Web)

**Mobile registration (actual, current design)** — all calls go to **Plant Gateway directly** (no CP backend involvement):

1. `POST /auth/register` — submits full sign-up form (business + contact fields)
2. `POST /auth/otp/start` — sends `{ "registration_id": "<uuid>" }` (NOT email)
3. User enters OTP on `OTPVerificationScreen`
4. `POST /auth/otp/verify` — sends `{ "otp_id": "...", "code": "..." }` → returns JWT tokens

**CP web registration (separate flow)** — uses CP backend endpoints (namespaced under `/api/cp/...`) and includes CAPTCHA/Plant duplicate checks:

- `POST /api/cp/auth/register/otp/start` (CP backend) → CAPTCHA + Plant duplicate lookup + OTP session create (via Plant Gateway)
- `POST /api/cp/auth/register` (CP backend) → OTP verify + customer creation (via Plant Gateway)

**Gotcha**: If a mobile build points its API base URL at `https://cp.<env>.waooaw.com` instead of `https://plant.<env>.waooaw.com`, auth endpoints like `/auth/register` will not exist (CP backend exposes `/api/cp/auth/...`), producing misleading failures.

**Plant Gateway requirement**: `/auth/register`, `/auth/otp/start`, and `/auth/otp/verify` must be treated as **public endpoints** (no JWT) consistently across Auth/RBAC/Policy middleware.

**Verification quick checks (demo)**:

```bash
# Plant Gateway should return 422 (validation), NOT 500 (JWT required)
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" -X POST https://plant.demo.waooaw.com/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@test.com"}'

# If this returns 404, your mobile build is probably hitting CP Backend (wrong base URL)
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" -I https://cp.demo.waooaw.com/auth/register
```

### Environments

Aligns with platform-wide standard. `EXPO_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT` (set inline in `eas.json` per profile) drives runtime behaviour.

| Environment | `EXPO_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT` | Plant API Base URL | Build type | Play Store track |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `development` | `development` | `https://${CODESPACE_NAME}-8000.app.github.dev` (runtime) | APK (debug) | — |
| `demo` | `demo` | `https://plant.demo.waooaw.com` | AAB (store) | internal |
| `uat` | `uat` | `https://plant.uat.waooaw.com` | APK (release) | alpha |
| `prod` | `prod` | `https://plant.waooaw.com` | AAB (store) | production |

---

### EAS Build Profiles (`src/mobile/eas.json`)

| Profile | `distribution` | `channel` | EAS `environment` | Output |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `development` | `internal` | `development` | `development` | APK (debug, Expo dev client) |
| `test-apk` | `internal` | — | `production` | APK (release) — **use this to test without Play Store re-signing** |
| `demo` | `store` | `demo` | `production` | AAB (release) |
| `uat` | `internal` | `uat` | `production` | APK (release) |
| `prod` | `store` | `production` | `production` | AAB (release) |

> **EAS constraint**: Custom environment names (`demo`, `uat`, `prod`) require a paid EAS plan. Free plan only supports `development`, `preview`, `production`. All three store profiles map to EAS `"environment": "production"` to get secrets injected. Runtime environment is differentiated via `EXPO_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT`.

---

### EAS Secrets (in EAS `production` environment)

> **Note**: These are pushed by CI from GitHub Secrets before each build (`eas secret:push`). See "Secrets — GitHub Secrets vs EAS Secrets" subsection below for full details.

| Variable | Value | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID_DEMO` | `270293855600-2shlgotsrqhv8doda15kr8noh74jjpcu.apps.googleusercontent.com` | Android OAuth (type=1 client; package `com.waooaw.app`) |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID_DEMO` | `270293855600-uoag582a6r5eqq4ho43l3mrvob6gpdmq.apps.googleusercontent.com` | Backend token exchange only |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL_DEMO` | `https://plant.demo.waooaw.com` | Plant Gateway base URL |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_OAUTH_REDIRECT_SCHEME_DEMO` | `com.googleusercontent.apps.270293855600-2shlgotsrqhv8doda15kr8noh74jjpcu` | Custom URI scheme for OAuth redirect |

---

### Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Framework | React Native + Expo Managed Workflow |
| Language | TypeScript |
| Navigation | `@react-navigation/native` (stack + bottom tabs) |
| State | Zustand (auth, UI) + React Query (server state) |
| HTTP | axios (same as web CP) |
| Auth | `@react-native-google-signin/google-signin` v16 (native SDK); JWTs minted by Plant via `POST /auth/google/verify`. Configure with `webClientId` so `aud` claim = Web client ID. |
| Storage | `secureStorage` wrapper: SecureStore (native) + web fallback (localStorage/sessionStorage/in-memory); AsyncStorage used for cache/backfill |
| UI | `react-native-paper`, `react-native-linear-gradient` |
| Lists | `@shopify/flash-list` ^1.8.3 (NOT v2 — requires new architecture) |
| Build | EAS CLI v18 (`eas-cli`) |
| OTA updates | Expo Updates (`expo-updates`) via EAS channels |
| Error tracking | `@sentry/react-native` (disabled in demo; enabled in uat/prod) |
| Testing | Jest + `@testing-library/react-native` + Detox (E2E) |

---

### Source Directory (`src/mobile/src/`)

| Directory | Contents |
|---|---|
| `config/` | `environment.config.ts`, `api.config.ts`, `oauth.config.ts`, `sentry.config.ts`, `razorpay.config.ts` |
| `screens/` | All app screens (auth/, agents/, home/, profile/, etc.) |
| `navigation/` | `RootNavigator`, `AuthNavigator`, `MainNavigator` — `AuthNavigator` uses render-prop pattern (not `component=` shorthand) for all three auth screens so custom props are forwarded. Sign In → Sign Up → OTP Verification stack. |
| `store/` | Zustand stores (`authStore.ts`, `uiStore.ts`) |
| `hooks/` | Custom hooks (`useGoogleAuth.ts`, `useAuthState.ts`, etc.) |
| `services/` | API service layer (mirrors CP web services) |
| `components/` | Shared UI components |
| `lib/` | `apiClient.ts` (axios instance) |
| `theme/` | Colors, typography, spacing tokens (dark theme) |
| `types/` | TypeScript type definitions |

### Key Root Files (`src/mobile/`)

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `eas.json` | EAS build profiles (development / demo / uat / prod) |
| `app.json` | Expo config — package name, version, plugins, scheme. Icon assets: `icon` = `./assets/WAOOAW Logo.png` (iOS, full-bleed OK); `android.adaptiveIcon.foregroundImage` = `./assets/adaptive-icon.png` (padded — logo at 682×682 centred on 1024×1024 transparent canvas, 17% gutter each side); `splash.image` = `./assets/WAOOAW Logo.png`. |
| `package.json` | Dependencies + npm scripts |
| `App.tsx` | App entry — Expo root + navigation shell. Wraps tree with `<SafeAreaProvider>` (required for `useSafeAreaInsets()` to return non-zero insets on Android edge-to-edge). |
| `secrets/google-play-service-account.json` | Play Store service account (gitignored; also in GCP Secret Manager) |

### Authentication (Google OAuth2 — Android)

### Codespaces Web Preview (Expo `--web`)

When running the mobile app as a **web preview** in Codespaces, two things matter:

1. **Env var injection happens at dev-server start** — ensure the Expo process is started with `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` and `EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_*` variables set, otherwise Google sign-in fails with `Missing required parameter: client_id`.

2. **Web needs an ID token** — the web provider flow must request an `id_token` so the app can exchange it at the Plant Gateway (`POST /auth/google/verify`).

3. **Token persistence on web** — `expo-secure-store` can be unavailable/blocked on web; token persistence uses the `secureStorage` web fallback so successful backend exchange does not fail at the “save tokens” step.

Critical implementation rules for Android with `@react-native-google-signin/google-signin` v16 (PR #751 — replaces deprecated `expo-auth-session`):

1. **Configure with `webClientId`** — the native SDK signs in silently via Google Play Services. The `webClientId` (GCP Web OAuth client, type=3) is passed to `GoogleSignin.configure()`. This is what sets the `aud` claim in the returned ID token so backends can validate it with `verify_oauth2_token()`. Do NOT pass the Android client ID here.

2. **ID token is returned directly** — `GoogleSignin.signIn()` returns `{ data: { idToken, user } }` — no redirect URI, no Chrome Custom Tab, no intent filter needed. The `idToken` is sent to `POST /auth/google/verify`.

3. **`DEVELOPER_ERROR` means SHA-1 mismatch** — the SHA-1 of the signing certificate on the device must match an entry in the GCP Android OAuth client (`270293855600-2shlgots…`). Two relevant SHA-1s:
   - **EAS keystore**: `14:F7:CC:EF:B7:D5:1C:1B:2F:FE:01:97:A5:D2:F6:9B:4F:B6:74:95` — registered, used for direct APK/AAB installs
   - **Play App Signing**: not yet registered — only obtainable after first AAB upload to Play Console → Setup → App integrity

4. **`DEVELOPER_ERROR` is now fixed for Play Store builds (PR #755)** — Play App Signing SHA-1 (`8F:D5:89:B1:20:14:85:E3:73:E8:0C:C0:B0:1B:56:74:E5:2F:5F:FA`) has been added to `google-services.json`, Firebase Console, and GCP OAuth Android client. Both EAS keystore and Play signing key are now registered. The fix takes effect from the next Play Store build. The registered SHA-1s are:
   - **EAS keystore** (upload key): `14:F7:CC:EF:B7:D5:1C:1B:2F:FE:01:97:A5:D2:F6:9B:4F:B6:74:95`
   - **Play App Signing key**: `8F:D5:89:B1:20:14:85:E3:73:E8:0C:C0:B0:1B:56:74:E5:2F:5F:FA` ← this was missing, now added

4b. **`test-apk` EAS profile bypasses Play Store re-signing** — for direct APK testing (`distribution: internal`). Builds are signed with the EAS keystore (SHA-1 above), no Play Store re-signing → no `DEVELOPER_ERROR`. Use `eas build --profile test-apk`.

5. **After OAuth success** — must call `login(authUser)` from `authStore` AND `userDataService.saveUserData(authUser)`. Without this, `isAuthenticated` stays false and navigation never switches to `MainNavigator`.

6. **On app restart** — `authStore.initialize()` has SecureStore fallback: if AsyncStorage is empty (Google auth writes to SecureStore, not AsyncStorage), reads from SecureStore and backfills AsyncStorage.

```typescript
// src/mobile/src/hooks/useGoogleAuth.ts — current implementation (v16 native SDK)
import { GoogleSignin, isSuccessResponse, isCancelledResponse } from '@react-native-google-signin/google-signin';

GoogleSignin.configure({ webClientId: process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID });

// Hook returns: { promptAsync, loading, error, userInfo, idToken, isConfigured }
// Call promptAsync() — NOT signIn() directly — to trigger the sign-in flow.

const promptAsync = async () => {
  await GoogleSignin.hasPlayServices({ showPlayServicesUpdateDialog: true });

  // CRITICAL: signOut() FIRST — clears Play Services credential cache.
  // Without this, signIn() silently reuses the last account and bypasses
  // the account chooser. signOut() does NOT revoke the user's Google grant.
  try { await GoogleSignin.signOut(); } catch { /* not signed in — OK */ }

  const response = await GoogleSignin.signIn();
  if (isCancelledResponse(response)) return;  // user dismissed picker
  if (!isSuccessResponse(response)) return;

  const { idToken } = response.data;
  // POST idToken to Plant Gateway /auth/google/verify
  // → { access_token, refresh_token, token_type, expires_in }
  // Then: authStore.login(user) + userDataService.saveUserData(user)
};
```

### Certificate Fingerprints & SHA-1 Keys

**Critical for Google OAuth Android Client Configuration**

When using EAS Build + Play Store App Signing, there are **two separate certificates**:

1. **Upload Certificate** (EAS-managed)
   - Used by EAS to sign the AAB before uploading to Play Store
   - ❌ **DO NOT use this SHA-1 for OAuth configuration**
   - Managed internally by Expo, not accessible to developers

2. **App Signing Certificate** (Play Store-managed)
   - Play Store re-signs the app with this certificate before distribution
   - ✅ **THIS is the correct SHA-1 for Google OAuth Android client**
   - Users' devices verify against this certificate

#### Current Production SHA-1 (App Signing Certificate)

| Algorithm | Fingerprint | Source | Last Verified |
|-----------|-------------|--------|---------------|
| **SHA-1** | `3A:E5:69:D6:03:65:C3:FF:26:56:55:66:24:F6:DB:5C:C4:37:64:07` | Play Console → App Integrity | 2026-02-23 |

> ⚠️ **SHA-1 conflict**: PR #755 (2026-02-24) registered Play App Signing key `8F:D5:89:B1:20:14:85:E3:73:E8:0C:C0:B0:1B:56:74:E5:2F:5F:FA` in GCP OAuth, Firebase, and `google-services.json`. The `3A:E5:69:D6…` fingerprint above was recorded on 2026-02-23 and likely refers to the **EAS upload certificate**, not the Play App Signing certificate. These are different keys. **Before any release**, re-verify the current SHA-1 in Play Console → Setup → App integrity → App signing key certificate and update the "Last Verified" date above.

**Where this SHA-1 is used**:
- GCP OAuth 2.0 Android Client: `270293855600-2shlgotsrqhv8doda15kr8noh74jjpcu.apps.googleusercontent.com`
- Package name: `com.waooaw.app`
- Redirect URI: `com.googleusercontent.apps.270293855600-2shlgotsrqhv8doda15kr8noh74jjpcu:/oauth2redirect`

#### How to Extract SHA-1 from Play Console

**Method 1: Direct from Play Console UI**
```bash
# 1. Go to: Play Console → Your App → Setup → App integrity
# 2. Find "App signing key certificate" section (NOT "Upload certificate")
# 3. Copy the SHA-1 fingerprint displayed
```

**Method 2: Download and Extract Locally**
```bash
# 1. In Play Console → App integrity → Download app signing certificate as PEM
# 2. Extract SHA-1:
openssl x509 -in app-signing-cert.pem -noout -fingerprint -sha1

# Output format:
# SHA1 Fingerprint=3A:E5:69:D6:03:65:C3:FF:26:56:55:66:24:F6:DB:5C:C4:37:64:07
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Do NOT use local keystore SHA-1**

The following commands extract fingerprints from **local keystores** which are **NOT valid** for EAS-managed builds:

```bash
# ❌ WRONG for production - this is the debug keystore
keytool -list -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore \
  -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android

# ❌ WRONG for EAS builds - EAS manages signing keys in the cloud
keytool -list -v -keystore /path/to/release.keystore -alias YOUR_ALIAS
```

#### Verification Before Each Release

Before promoting builds to production:

```bash
# 1. Get SHA-1 from Play Console (Method 1 above)
PLAY_SHA1="[paste from Play Console]"

# 2. Get SHA-1 from GCP OAuth client:
# https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
GCP_SHA1="[paste from GCP Console]"

# 3. Compare
if [ "$PLAY_SHA1" = "$GCP_SHA1" ]; then
  echo "✅ SHA-1 matches - OAuth will work"
else
  echo "❌ MISMATCH - Update GCP OAuth client immediately"
  echo "   Play Store: $PLAY_SHA1"
  echo "   GCP Config:  $GCP_SHA1"
fi
```

#### Emergency: OAuth Fails After Deployment

If Google sign-in suddenly fails with `Error 401: invalid_client` or `Error 400: invalid_request` after a Play Store release:

1. **Check for SHA-1 mismatch** - Play Store may have rotated the app signing key
2. **Extract current SHA-1** from Play Console (see methods above)
3. **Update GCP OAuth client** with new SHA-1
4. **Wait 5-10 minutes** for Google to propagate changes
5. **Test again** - OAuth should work with updated SHA-1

### CI/CD — GitHub Actions Workflow

**File**: `.github/workflows/mobile-playstore-deploy.yml`

| Input | Options | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `environment` | `demo`, `uat`, `prod` | `demo` |
| `track` | `internal`, `alpha`, `beta`, `production` | `internal` |
| `build_method` | `expo`, `local-eas`, `existing` | `expo` |
| `build_id` | (EAS build UUID) | — |

Profile mapping is now **1:1** — `environment` = `build-profile` (no more `demo → demo-store` translation).

**Version naming**: The workflow reads `expo.version` from `app.json` as-is and does NOT overwrite it. The `versionCode` is auto-incremented remotely by EAS (`appVersionSource: remote` + `autoIncrement: versionCode`). To bump the user-facing version, update `expo.version` in `src/mobile/app.json` and commit before triggering the workflow.

**Quick trigger (demo → Play Store internal)**:
```bash
gh workflow run mobile-playstore-deploy.yml \
  -f environment=demo -f track=internal -f build_method=expo
```

**Manual build + submit from Codespaces**:
```bash
export EXPO_TOKEN=<token>   # from https://expo.dev/accounts/waooaw/settings/access-tokens
cd src/mobile
eas build --platform android --profile demo --non-interactive
eas submit --platform android --profile demo --id <BUILD_ID> --non-interactive
```

### Testing

| Type | Command | Framework |
|---|---|---|
| Unit | `cd src/mobile && npm test` | Jest + React Native Testing Library |
| Unit (coverage) | `cd src/mobile && npm run test:coverage` | Jest coverage |
| E2E (Android) | `cd src/mobile && npm run test:e2e:android` | Detox |
| Firebase Test Lab | `src/mobile/package.json`, `src/mobile/eas.json`, CI workflow/test scripts | gcloud FTL (Robo test) |

**Verified FTL device matrix** (2026-02-21):
- `oriole` (Pixel 6), version `33` (Android 13) ✅
- `redfin` (Pixel 5), version `30` (Android 11) ✅
- ❌ Do NOT use `oriole+34` or `redfin+33` — incompatible, silently skipped

### Play Store Service Account

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Email | `waooaw-mobile-deployment@waooaw-mobile.iam.gserviceaccount.com` |
| Key file | `src/mobile/secrets/google-play-service-account.json` (gitignored) |
| GCP Secret Manager | `GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` |
| GitHub Actions secret | `GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` |
| Key path in eas.json | `./secrets/google-play-service-account.json` |

> **⚠️ Required one-time setup — Play Console permissions (NOT GCP IAM)**
>
> The service account needs **Release Manager** permission granted inside Google Play Console. This is separate from GCP IAM and must be done by whoever owns the Play Console developer account.
>
> 1. Open [play.google.com/console](https://play.google.com/console)
> 2. **Users and permissions** (left sidebar, account-level)
> 3. Find or invite: `waooaw-mobile-deployment@waooaw-mobile.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
> 4. Set role → **Release Manager**
> 5. Save — no acceptance/confirmation needed from the service account (it is not a real user)
>
> Without this, `eas submit` will fail with: *"The service account is missing the necessary permissions to submit the app to Google Play Store."*

### Mobile-Specific Gotchas

| Gotcha | Detail |
|---|---|
| `@shopify/flash-list` version | Must be `^1.8.3` — v2 requires `newArchEnabled: true` which is `false` in this app. App crashes on launch if v2 is used. |
| EAS secrets not injecting | Profile must have `"environment": "production"` in `eas.json`. Without it, `EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID` is empty → falls back to web client ID → Google OAuth returns `Error 400`. |
| `eas token:create` does not exist | EAS CLI v18 removed this command. Create tokens at https://expo.dev/accounts/waooaw/settings/access-tokens |
| `eas download` rejects non-simulator builds | For AABs: use `curl -H "expo-session: $SESSION"` with the artifact URL from `eas build:view <ID> --json` |
| Play Store ignores re-uploads | If versionCode is the same as a previous upload, Play Console silently ignores it. `autoIncrement: versionCode` in `eas.json` handles this automatically. |
| `@react-native-google-signin` needs `webClientId` | Pass the **Web** OAuth client ID (not the Android one) to `GoogleSignin.configure({ webClientId })`. This sets the `aud` claim so backends can validate with `verify_oauth2_token()`. Using the Android client ID here causes `DEVELOPER_ERROR`. |
| `DEVELOPER_ERROR` = SHA-1 mismatch | Both SHA-1s are now registered: EAS keystore `14:F7:CC:EF…` and Play App Signing `8F:D5:89:B1…`. If error reappears after a Play Store release, re-check Play Console → App integrity for a rotated signing key. |
| OTP screen stuck after verification | `login()` must be called after `verifyOTP()` — AuthNavigator only switches to `MainNavigator` when `isAuthenticated === true` in Zustand store. |
| Re-auth on restart | `authStore.initialize()` must check SecureStore when AsyncStorage is empty (Google OAuth writes only to SecureStore, not AsyncStorage). |
| Google Sign-In skips account picker | `GoogleSignin.signIn()` silently reuses Play Services cached credentials. Always call `await GoogleSignin.signOut()` before `signIn()` in `promptAsync` to force the account chooser on every tap. `signOut()` clears cache only — it does NOT revoke the user's Google OAuth grant. |
| Adaptive icon clipped on Android | `android.adaptiveIcon.foregroundImage` must have a 17% transparent gutter on each side — Android's circular mask covers only the centre 66% of the canvas. Use a 1024×1024 canvas with the logo at ≤682×682 centred. Full-bleed images (no padding) will be clipped. Current file: `assets/adaptive-icon.png` (correct). Root `icon` for iOS can remain full-bleed. |
| React Navigation custom prop not received | Using `component={MyScreen}` shorthand passes only `navigation` and `route` props. To forward custom props (e.g. `onSignUpPress`), use the render-prop pattern: `<Stack.Screen name="X">{(props) => <MyScreen {...props} onSignUpPress={...} />}</Stack.Screen>`. AuthNavigator uses render-prop for all three auth screens. |
| `SafeAreaProvider` required at root | `react-native-safe-area-context` returns zero insets everywhere until `<SafeAreaProvider>` is mounted at the app root (`App.tsx`). Without it, `SafeAreaView edges` and `useSafeAreaInsets()` have no effect regardless of which edges are declared. |

---

### Secrets — GitHub Secrets vs EAS Secrets

**These are two separate systems.** Confusing them is the #1 source of "env var not injected" bugs.

| System | Where stored | Available where | Format in eas.json |
|---|---|---|---|
| **GitHub Secrets** | `github.com/repo → Settings → Secrets → Actions` | GitHub Actions runner only (`${{ secrets.VAR }}`) | N/A directly |
| **EAS Secrets** | `expo.dev/accounts/waooaw → Project → Secrets` | Expo cloud build servers (resolves `$VAR` in eas.json `env` blocks) | `"$VAR_NAME"` |

**The bridge**: The workflow runs `eas secret:push` before each build to copy GitHub Secrets → EAS Secrets. Defined in the "Sync EAS Secrets from GitHub Secrets" step in `.github/workflows/mobile-playstore-deploy.yml`.

#### Required GitHub Secrets (Demo — must exist in repo settings)

| GitHub Secret Name | Value | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID_DEMO` | `270293855600-2shlgotsrqhv8doda15kr8noh74jjpcu.apps.googleusercontent.com` | Android OAuth client ID (type=1) |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID_DEMO` | `270293855600-uoag582a6r5eqq4ho43l3mrvob6gpdmq.apps.googleusercontent.com` | Web OAuth client (backend token exchange) |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL_DEMO` | `https://plant.demo.waooaw.com` | Plant Gateway URL for demo |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_OAUTH_REDIRECT_SCHEME_DEMO` | `com.googleusercontent.apps.270293855600-2shlgotsrqhv8doda15kr8noh74jjpcu` | Custom URI scheme for OAuth redirect |
| `EXPO_TOKEN` | (from expo.dev access tokens) | Authenticates EAS CLI in CI |
| `GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` | (JSON key from GCP) | Uploads AAB to Play Store |

#### How EAS secret substitution works

```
eas.json: "EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID": "$EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID_DEMO"
                                                      ↑
                         EAS resolves this at build time from EAS project secrets
                         (NOT from GitHub Secrets or shell environment)
```

The workflow "Sync EAS Secrets" step runs `eas secret:push --scope project --env-file /tmp/eas-secrets.env --force` to populate EAS secrets from GitHub Secrets before triggering the EAS cloud build.

#### Diagnosing secret injection failures

If a build results in `client_id=$EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID_DEMO` (literal, not substituted):
1. The GitHub Secret exists but was never pushed to EAS
2. The build ran before the "Sync EAS Secrets" step completed
3. The EAS profile `"environment"` key is missing or wrong (`"production"` required for non-development secrets)

---

### Design System

All design tokens are in `src/mobile/src/theme/`. The theme is **dark-first**, matching the web CP Frontend exactly.

#### Colors (`src/mobile/src/theme/colors.ts`)

| Token | Hex / Value | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `colors.black` | `#0a0a0a` | Primary background |
| `colors.grayDark` / `colors.card` | `#18181b` | Card / secondary background |
| `colors.backgroundTertiary` / `colors.cardHover` | `#27272a` | Hover state, borders |
| `colors.neonCyan` | `#00f2fe` | Primary accent (focus, CTA, neon glow) |
| `colors.neonPurple` | `#667eea` | Secondary accent |
| `colors.neonPink` | `#f093fb` | Tertiary accent / gradient |
| `colors.statusOnline` | `#10b981` | Agent available (green) |
| `colors.statusWorking` | `#f59e0b` | Agent working (yellow) |
| `colors.statusOffline` | `#ef4444` | Agent offline (red) |
| `colors.textPrimary` | `#ffffff` | Primary text |
| `colors.textSecondary` | `#a1a1aa` | Supporting text |
| `colors.textMuted` | `#71717a` | Hints, placeholders |
| `colors.border` | `#27272a` | Default border |
| `colors.borderFocus` | `#00f2fe` | Focus ring (neon cyan) |

Use `ColorUtils.getStatusColor(status)` and `ColorUtils.getSemanticColor(type)` for programmatic access.

#### Typography (`src/mobile/src/theme/typography.ts`)

| Font | Usage |
|---|---|
| **Space Grotesk** 700 Bold | Display / screen headings |
| **Outfit** | Section headings |
| **Inter** | Body, labels, inputs |

All three fonts are loaded via `@expo-google-fonts/space-grotesk`, `@expo-google-fonts/outfit`, `@expo-google-fonts/inter` in `App.tsx` using `useFonts()`.

#### Spacing (`src/mobile/src/theme/spacing.ts`)

4pt base grid: `xs=4, sm=8, md=16, lg=24, xl=32, xxl=48`. Use `spacing.md` not raw `16`.

#### Theme Provider

`src/mobile/src/theme/ThemeProvider.tsx` wraps the app. Access via `useTheme()` hook (`src/mobile/src/hooks/useTheme.ts`).

### Services & API Endpoints

All services use the `apiClient` singleton (`src/mobile/src/lib/apiClient.ts`) — an Axios instance pointing at `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` (Plant Gateway). The gateway requires `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>` on all protected endpoints.

#### Auth endpoints (`src/mobile/src/services/auth.service.ts`)

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/auth/google/verify` | Exchange Google `id_token` for WAOOAW JWT. Body: `{ id_token, source: "mobile" }`. Response: `{ access_token, refresh_token, token_type, expires_in }` |
| `POST` | `/auth/refresh` | Refresh access token. Body: `{ refresh_token }` |
| `POST` | `/auth/logout` | Invalidate tokens |

#### Agent endpoints (`src/mobile/src/services/agents/agent.service.ts`)

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/v1/agents` | List agents (query params: `industry`, `min_rating`, `page`, `limit`) |
| `GET` | `/v1/agents/:agentId` | Agent detail |

#### Hired Agents (`src/mobile/src/services/hiredAgents/hiredAgents.service.ts`)

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/v1/hired_agents` | Active hired agents for current customer |
| `GET` | `/v1/hired_agents/:id` | Hired agent detail + trial status |

#### Payments (`src/mobile/src/services/payment/razorpay.service.ts`)

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/v1/payments/create-order` | Create Razorpay order |
| `POST` | `/v1/payments/verify` | Verify payment signature |
| `POST` | `/v1/payments/refund` | Initiate refund |
| `GET` | `/v1/payments/:paymentId/status` | Payment status |

#### Registration (`src/mobile/src/services/registration.service.ts`)

Handles mobile customer registration and OTP-based auth. All three steps call Plant Gateway directly (no CP Backend involvement). The `registration_id` returned by `/auth/register` is the customer UUID and must be passed to `/auth/otp/start`.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/auth/register` | Create customer account. Body: `CustomerCreate` (camelCase fields). Response: `{ registration_id, email, phone, created }` |
| `POST` | `/auth/otp/start` | Start OTP challenge. Body: `{ registration_id, channel? }`. Response: `{ otp_id, channel, destination_masked, expires_in_seconds, otp_code? }` (`otp_code` echoed only in dev/demo env) |
| `POST` | `/auth/otp/verify` | Verify OTP, receive JWT tokens. Body: `{ otp_id, code }`. Response: `{ access_token, refresh_token, token_type, expires_in }` |

All three paths are in `PUBLIC_ENDPOINTS` in `src/Plant/Gateway/middleware/auth.py` — no JWT required.

#### Token Management (`src/mobile/src/services/tokenManager.service.ts`)

Manages access/refresh token lifecycle: reads from `secureStorage`, handles auto-refresh via Axios interceptor (retry queue pattern for concurrent requests during refresh).

#### Push Notifications (`src/mobile/src/services/notifications/pushNotifications.service.ts`)

Registers device FCM token with Plant Backend after sign-in. On sign-in success, calls `POST /api/v1/customers/fcm-token` (authenticated) to store the token against the customer record. Required for agent status + deliverable ready push notifications (MOBILE-FUNC-1 #866, #867).

#### MOB-PARITY-1 Services (PR #1060)

| Service | File | Plant Gateway Path |
|---|---|---|
| Content Analytics | `src/services/contentAnalytics.service.ts` | `GET /api/v1/hired-agents/{id}/content-analytics` |
| Invoices | `src/services/invoices.service.ts` | `GET /api/v1/invoices` |
| Platform Connections | `src/services/platformConnections.service.ts` | `GET/POST/DELETE /api/v1/hired-agents/{id}/platform-connections` |
| Receipts | `src/services/receipts.service.ts` | `GET /api/v1/receipts/{id}` |

---

### State Management

#### Auth Store (`src/mobile/src/store/authStore.ts`)

Zustand store — single source of truth for authentication state.

| State field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `isAuthenticated` | `boolean` | Gate for `RootNavigator`; only true after `login()` called |
| `user` | `AuthUser \| null` | `{ customer_id, email, full_name?, phone?, business_name? }` |
| `isLoading` | `boolean` | True during `initialize()` — show splash until resolved |

| Action | Effect |
|---|---|
| `login(user)` | Sets `isAuthenticated = true`, stores user — triggers nav switch to `Main` |
| `logout()` | Clears tokens (SecureStore) + user data + resets state |
| `updateUser(partial)` | Merge updates into `user` |
| `initialize()` | Called on app start — reads SecureStore, restores session if valid, sets `isLoading = false` |

**Critical**: After Google OAuth + backend JWT exchange, call **both** `authStore.login(user)` **and** `userDataService.saveUserData(user)`. Missing either keeps the user stuck on the auth screen.

#### SecureStore Keys (`src/mobile/src/lib/secureStorage.ts`)

| Key constant | SecureStore key | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `ACCESS_TOKEN` | `cp_access_token` | JWT access token |
| `REFRESH_TOKEN` | `cp_refresh_token` | JWT refresh token |
| `TOKEN_EXPIRES_AT` | `token_expires_at` | Unix timestamp (seconds) |
| `USER_ID` | `user_id` | WAOOAW customer ID |
| `USER_EMAIL` | `user_email` | User email |
| `USER_NAME` | `user_name` | Display name |
| `USER_PICTURE` | `user_picture` | Avatar URL |
| `BIOMETRIC_ENABLED` | `biometric_enabled` | Biometric auth flag |

| `integration/auth.test.ts` | Requires live backend; skip in unit CI |
| `integration/api.test.ts` | Requires live backend |
| `integration/fontLoading.test.ts` | Expo font loading async |
| `api.config.test.ts` | Environment-specific URL assertions |
| `razorpay.service.test.ts` | Native module dependency |
| `e2e/app-launch.test.js` | Detox only — run via `test:e2e:android` |

#### Coverage Scope

Coverage is collected from `src/services/**/*.{ts,tsx}` and `src/lib/apiClient.ts`. Threshold: **80% statements/branches/functions/lines**. Voice, analytics, monitoring, payment, and hiredAgents service sub-trees are excluded from coverage enforcement.

---

### Hooks Reference

| Hook | File | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `useGoogleAuth()` | `hooks/useGoogleAuth.ts` | `{ promptAsync, loading, error, userInfo, idToken, isConfigured }` — call `promptAsync()` to trigger sign-in; internally does `signOut()` then `signIn()` to always show account picker |
| `useAuthState()` | aliased from authStore | `{ isAuthenticated, user, isLoading }` |
| `useAgents(filters)` | `hooks/useAgents.ts` | React Query result for agent list |
| `useAgentDetail(agentId)` | `hooks/useAgentDetail.ts` | React Query result for single agent |
| `useHiredAgents()` | `hooks/useHiredAgents.ts` | Active hired agents + trials |
| `useNetworkStatus()` | `hooks/useNetworkStatus.ts` | `{ isConnected, isInternetReachable }` |
| `useTheme()` | `hooks/useTheme.ts` | Full theme object (colors, typography, spacing) |
| `useVoiceCommands()` | `hooks/useVoiceCommands.ts` | Voice command recognition + parsed intent |
| `useSpeechToText()` | `hooks/useSpeechToText.ts` | STT recording state + transcript |
| `useTextToSpeech()` | `hooks/useTextToSpeech.ts` | TTS playback |
| `useRazorpay()` | `hooks/useRazorpay.ts` | Payment initiation + result |
| `usePerformanceMonitoring()` | `hooks/usePerformanceMonitoring.ts` | Screen trace start/stop |

---

### Lib Utilities

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `lib/apiClient.ts` | Axios instance with auth interceptor + token refresh queue |
| `lib/secureStorage.ts` | Typed wrapper for `expo-secure-store` (iOS Keychain / Android KeyStore) |
| `lib/errorHandler.ts` | Normalises API, network, and auth errors to `AppError` type |
| `lib/networkStatus.ts` | `netinfo` wrapper with observable status |
| `lib/offlineCache.ts` | AsyncStorage-backed cache for offline-first reads |
| `lib/performanceMonitoring.ts` | Firebase Performance trace helpers |
| `lib/accessibility.ts` | WCAG helpers, `accessibilityLabel` generators |

---

### Voice Features

Voice is a progressive feature — it degrades gracefully if permissions are denied.

| Service | File | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Speech-to-text | `services/voice/speechToText.service.ts` | Uses `expo-speech` (STT) |
| Text-to-speech | `services/voice/textToSpeech.service.ts` | Uses `expo-speech` (TTS) |
| Command parser | `services/voice/voiceCommandParser.service.ts` | Maps transcript → app intents |
| Components | `components/voice/` | `VoiceFAB`, `VoiceControl`, `VoiceHelpModal` |

Disable completely: remove `VoiceFAB` from `MainNavigator`. No other code changes needed.

---

### Analytics & Monitoring

| Service | Enabled in demo | File |
|---|---|---|
| Firebase Analytics | ✅ (with consent) | `services/analytics/firebase.analytics.ts` |
| Firebase Crashlytics | ✅ | `services/monitoring/crashlytics.service.ts` |
| Firebase Performance | ✅ | `services/monitoring/performance.service.ts` |
| Sentry | ❌ (enabled uat/prod) | `src/config/sentry.config.ts` |

Consent gate: `AnalyticsConsentModal` shown on first launch. Decision persisted in SecureStore.

## 25. Session Commentary Protocol — Context Recovery

> **MANDATORY for all agents**: After completing each logical task, append a timestamped entry to `session_commentary.md` at the repo root. This file is the primary recovery mechanism when connections drop or sessions reset mid-task.

### 25.1 Purpose

Long-running tasks (multi-PR refactors, multi-step debugging) frequently span multiple agent sessions. Without an explicit log, a reconnecting agent must re-read all files from scratch, wasting tokens and often missing critical in-flight state (e.g. "PR #852 is CI-green, waiting for merge", "test is failing because of X not Y").

`session_commentary.md` solves this: it is an append-only journal at the repo root that any agent can read in seconds to reconstruct working context.

### 25.2 File location

```
/session_commentary.md      ← repo root, always
```

### 25.3 On session start — read first

Before doing anything else in a new session, run:

```bash
tail -120 session_commentary.md
```

Read the last 3–5 entries. They tell you:
- What branch/PR is active
- What was last completed
- What the next step is
- Any blocking conditions

### 25.4 When to append

Append **immediately after** completing each of these logical task boundaries:

| Boundary | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Analysis complete | Root cause identified, architecture decision made |
| Code change complete | Bug fixed, feature implemented, refactor done |
| Tests run | All pass, or specific failures noted |
| Commit + push | Branch pushed to remote |
| PR created or updated | PR number and URL known |
| CI result known | All checks green / specific checks failing |
| Blocked / waiting | Waiting for merge, waiting for user input |
| Session end | Agent about to hand off or go idle |

**Do not** batch entries. Write each boundary as it happens. Append even for partial progress — a partial log is infinitely better than silence.

### 25.5 Entry format

Append this block verbatim, filling in the fields:

```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC] <Short task title (8 words max)>

**Branch**: `<branch-name>`
**PR**: #<number> (<url>) | None yet
**Status**: Completed | In Progress | Blocked

### What was done
<2–5 sentences. What problem, what decision, what action.>

### Outcome
- <concrete result — e.g. "5/5 tests pass", "PR #N created", "CI green">
- <second bullet if needed>

### Key files changed
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `path/to/file` | what changed |

### Next step
<One sentence: what should be done next if resuming from here.>

### Recovery hint
<Non-obvious state that would be lost otherwise: pending merges, blocked-by, env quirks, secret names, test isolation issues, etc.>
```

### 25.6 Format rules

- Timestamp in **UTC**, ISO-8601 format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC`
- Title ≤ 8 words — enough to skim the file like a git log
- **Never edit or delete past entries** — append only
- Keep each entry under 30 lines; link to PRs/commits for detail
- If the session produces only one entry, that is fine — write it at session end

### 25.7 Bootstrap (first time in a repo session)

If `session_commentary.md` does not exist yet, create it:

```bash
cat > session_commentary.md << 'EOF'
# Session Commentary — WAOOAW

> Append-only log for context recovery. Read last 3–5 entries on session start.

---
EOF
```

Then immediately append the first entry for the current task.

### 25.8 Recovery procedure for a reconnecting agent

1. `tail -120 session_commentary.md` — scan last entries
2. Check **Branch** and **PR** fields — verify branch is still checked out (`git status`)
3. Check **Next step** field — start there
4. Check **Recovery hint** — resolve any blockers before coding
5. Confirm CI state if a PR exists: `gh pr checks <N> --repo dlai-sd/WAOOAW`
6. Resume and append a new entry: "Resumed session — continuing from <previous title>"

### 25.8b Enforcement gate (agent-pre-push.sh)

`scripts/agent-pre-push.sh` emits a **WARNING** (non-blocking) when `session_commentary.md` has not been modified in the current branch:

```bash
# In scripts/agent-pre-push.sh — session commentary staleness check
if ! git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD 2>/dev/null | grep -q "session_commentary.md"; then
  echo "⚠️  WARNING: session_commentary.md has no new entries in this branch."
  echo "   Append a session entry per §25 before pushing to main."
fi
```

This is a warning, not a hard exit. Any PR review that finds `session_commentary.md` unchanged should treat it as a process gap.

### 25.9 Example entry

```markdown
## [2026-03-04 14:20 UTC] Applied Razorpay amount + prefill fix

**Branch**: `fix/portal-nav-and-payments-mode-cp`
**PR**: #852 — https://github.com/dlai-sd/WAOOAW/pull/852
**Status**: Completed

### What was done
Added missing `amount` and `prefill` fields to the Razorpay constructor options
in BookingModal.tsx. Without `amount`, Razorpay checkout.js cannot render the
payment method selection screen (UPI, card, netbanking).

### Outcome
- All 5 BookingModal tests pass (3/5 before fix)
- CI: 12/12 checks green on PR #852

### Key files changed
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/CP/FrontEnd/src/components/BookingModal.tsx` | `amount` + `prefill` added |
| `src/CP/FrontEnd/src/test/BookingModal.test.tsx` | Button name assertions + regression guard |

### Next step
Merge PR #852, then open docs PR for session commentary protocol.

### Recovery hint
PR #852 was all CI-green. User confirmed intent to merge.
```

## 26. Agent Construct Design — Quick Reference

> **Full document**: [`docs/PP/AGENT-CONSTRUCT-DESIGN.md`](PP/AGENT-CONSTRUCT-DESIGN.md) — v2, 2179 lines, 2026-03-07.

> **§ number disambiguation**: The `§N` references in this quick-reference table (e.g. `§4`, `§13`, `§14`) refer to section numbers **within `docs/PP/AGENT-CONSTRUCT-DESIGN.md`**, NOT to sections of this document (`CONTEXT_AND_INDEX.md`). Both documents use `§` numbering. When cross-referencing, always write the full form **`AGENT-CONSTRUCT-DESIGN.md §N`** to avoid ambiguity.

This document is the **single source of truth** for all construct-pipeline design decisions. Read it in full before modifying `agent_mold/`, any Scheduler/Pump/Processor/Connector/Publisher code, or the HookBus.

| § | Topic | Quick pointer |

| §8 | End-to-end execution flow diagram | — |
| §9 | NFR requirements per construct | See §17 (Gotchas) |
| §10 | Environment flags: `CAMPAIGN_PERSISTENCE_MODE`, `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_ENABLED`, `SCHEDULER_ENABLED`, `APPROVAL_GATE_ENABLED` | See §14 |
| §11 | Historical mould-gap outcomes now reflected in live runtime + PP ops files | `docs/PP/AGENT-CONSTRUCT-DESIGN.md`, `src/PP/BackEnd/api/ops_hired_agents.py`, `src/PP/FrontEnd/src/components/ConstructHealthPanel.tsx` |
| §13 | CP UX — construct surfaces in Customer Portal; 5 missing CP routes; screen-by-screen changes | See §4.3 |
| §14 | PP Service-Centre vision; 7-role RBAC; 10 missing PP routes; 7 new PP screens | See §4.4 |
| §15 | Key DB tables quick reference (12 tables) | See §10 |
| §16 | Suggested improvements requiring user sign-off (WebSocket, swipe-to-approve, OAuth expiry UI) | — |

**When to read this doc:**
- Before implementing any new GoalRun, Deliverable, or approval flow
- Before adding a new agent type to `reference_agents.py`
- Before modifying `ConstraintPolicy` fields or `LifecycleHooks` signatures
- Before adding PP diagnostic routes or PP FrontEnd construct-health screens
- Before changing how TradingProcessor produces output (always `draft_only=True`)
