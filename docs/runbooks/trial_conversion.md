### Conversion Workflow (Step-by-Step)

**Step 1: Initiate Conversion in PP**

```bash
# PP > Trials > [Customer ID] > Convert to Paid
# Or via API:
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $PP_TOKEN" \
  https://api.waooaw.com/pp/trials/<trial_id>/convert \
  --data '{
    "plan": "standard",
    "billing_cycle": "monthly",
    "payment_method_id": "<payment_method_id>"
  }'
```

**Step 2: Process Payment**

```bash
# System automatically:
# 1. Creates subscription in Razorpay
# 2. Charges first month (₹12,000)
# 3. Sets up recurring billing
# 4. Generates invoice

# Verify payment successful
# PP > Billing > Payments > [Customer ID]
# Status should be: "succeeded"
```

**Step 3: Update Subscription Status**

```bash
# System automatically updates:
UPDATE subscriptions
SET 
  status = 'active',
  trial_status = 'converted',
  trial_end_at = NULL,
  plan_type = 'standard',
  billing_cycle = 'monthly',
  next_billing_date = NOW() + INTERVAL '1 month'
WHERE customer_id = '<customer_id>' AND id = '<subscription_id>';
```

**Step 4: Remove Trial Limits**

```bash
# Limits automatically removed:
UPDATE hired_agents
SET 
  daily_task_limit = NULL,     -- Remove 5/day limit
  total_token_limit = NULL,     -- Remove 10k token limit
  high_cost_approval = false    -- Optional: Remove approval requirement

```
