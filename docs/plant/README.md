# Plant Phase - Genesis Agent Production Implementation

**Status:** 🌱 Ready for Specification  
**Phase:** Plant (Production Systems Implementation)  
**Prerequisites:** Seed Phase Complete (PP v1.0 gap resolution)  
**Timeline:** 3-4 weeks  
**Updated:** 2026-01-08

---

## Phase Overview

The **Plant Phase** implements the Genesis Agent production webhook system and constitutional governance capabilities, replacing the mock stub from Seed phase with production-ready components.

### Scope

**Systems Architect Responsibilities:**
- Genesis webhook production architecture (scalability, resilience, fault tolerance)
- Precedent seed storage and retrieval infrastructure (PostgreSQL + vector embeddings)
- Constitutional query API optimization (response time <100ms, cache hit rate >80%)
- Health monitoring and observability (Genesis-specific metrics)
- Blue-green deployment strategy for Genesis updates

**Vision Guardian Responsibilities:**
- Constitutional validation criteria definition (bias detection, harmful content rules, alignment metrics)
- Ethics gate implementation (risk levels 1-4, graduated escalation)
- Precedent seed quality assurance (prevent constitutional contradiction)
- Constitutional drift detection (L0/L1 changes require Genesis re-certification)
- Agent suspension criteria (when Genesis must reject or escalate)

**Genesis Integration:**
- Replace mock server (port 9000) with production webhook (authenticated, scalable, monitored)
- Constitutional query API production endpoint (extends Port 8004)
- Precedent seed lifecycle management (seeding, supersession, deprecation)
- Agent DNA initialization (5 required files, hash chain, validation)
- Skill certification workflow (Think→Act→Observe cycle validation)

## Constitutional Context

**Immutable Principles (L0):**
- Single Governor Invariant: One Platform Governor session active at any time
- Deny-by-Default: Explicit approval required for external interactions
- Agent Specialization: Jobs not assistants, restrictive boundaries force excellence
- Constitutional Embodiment: Constitution embedded via vector embeddings, semantic search, RAG

**Foundational Governance Agents (3):**
1. **Genesis** - Certifies Jobs/Skills, initializes agent DNA (5 files), validates precedent seeds
2. **Systems Architect** - Designs production architecture, reviews infrastructure changes
3. **Vision Guardian** - Enforces ethics gates, detects constitutional violations, break-glass override

**Amendment AMENDMENT-001 (2026-01-07):**
- AI Agent DNA & Job/Skills Lifecycle
- Filesystem memory (agents/{agent_id}/state/ with 5 required files)
- Vector embeddings + semantic search + RAG for constitutional queries
- Precedent seed lifecycle (active → superseded → deprecated → archived)

---

## Prerequisites (Seed Phase Deliverables)

✅ **Complete:**
- PP v1.0 Core Components (10 components)
- Deep Audit Gap Resolution (10 Critical gaps resolved)
- Constitutional Amendment AMENDMENT-001 (Agent DNA model)
- Genesis Webhook API Stub (mock server port 9000)
- Constitutional Query API specification (GAP-9)
- Documentation (20,000+ lines of specifications)

---

## Plant Phase Goals

**Primary Objectives:**
1. Deploy production Genesis webhook (replace mock, authenticated, monitored)
2. Implement constitutional validation engine (bias detection, harmful content filtering)
3. Deploy precedent seed storage (PostgreSQL + vector embeddings + query API)
4. Implement agent DNA initialization (Genesis authority, 5 files, validation)
5. Deploy health monitoring (Genesis-specific metrics, SLA tracking)
6. Integrate constitutional query API (production endpoint, <100ms response)

**Success Criteria:**
- Genesis webhook handles 100 req/sec with <200ms latency
- Constitutional validation detects 95%+ of policy violations in testing
- Precedent seed query cache hit rate >80%
- Agent DNA initialization success rate >99.5%
- Zero constitutional drift undetected (daily audits)
- Full audit trail for all Genesis decisions (append-only logs)

## Next Steps

1. **User provides high-level Plant journey** (Portal user journey for Genesis integration)
2. **Agent validates against constitution** (audit and fitment check)
3. **Agent creates detailed journey** (with gaps, solutions, self-answered questions in bullets)
4. **Update CONTEXT_NEXT_SESSION.md** (document Plant tasks)
5. **Confirm readiness** (final checkpoint before implementation)
