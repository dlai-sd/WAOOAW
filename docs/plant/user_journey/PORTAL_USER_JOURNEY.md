# Plant Phase - Portal User Journey (Genesis Integration)

**Status:** 🌱 Template - Awaiting User Input  
**Phase:** Plant (Production Systems Implementation)  
**User Type:** Platform Governor, Platform Architect, Genesis Agent  
**Updated:** 2026-01-08

## Document Purpose

This document describes the **user journey for Genesis Agent production implementation** from the perspective of Platform Portal users interacting with Genesis certification workflows, constitutional validation, and precedent seed management.

**Read Order:** [Foundation.md](../../../main/Foundation.md) → [PP User Journey](../../PP/user_journey/PP_USER_JOURNEY.md) → **This Document**

## High-Level Journey (Awaiting User Input)

> **Status:** Awaiting user to share high-level Plant phase user journey.
> 
> **Expected Scope:**
> - Portal screens for Genesis webhook configuration
> - Constitutional validation workflows (bias detection, harmful content)
> - Precedent seed management UI (search, supersede, deprecate)
> - Agent DNA initialization monitoring
> - Skill certification workflow (Platform Portal interface)
> - Health monitoring dashboards (Genesis-specific metrics)
> - Break-glass scenarios (Vision Guardian override)
>
> **Agent will expand:** Once user provides high-level journey, agent will:
> 1. Validate against constitutional principles (L0/L1 compliance)
> 2. Perform fitment audit (gap analysis with existing PP components)
> 3. Create detailed journey with gaps/solutions (bullet format, 1-2 lines each)
> 4. Self-answer constitutional questions (demonstrate understanding)
> 5. Document in this file + PORTAL_USER_JOURNEY.yaml

## Journey Stages (Template)

### Stage 1: [To Be Defined by User]

**User Actions:**
- [Awaiting user input]

**System Behavior:**
- [Awaiting user input]

**Constitutional Checkpoints:**
- [Agent will define after user input, based on L0/L1 principles]

**Gaps Identified:**
- [Agent will identify after constitutional validation]

**Solutions:**
- [Agent will propose in bullet format, 1-2 lines each]

## Self-Answered Constitutional Questions

> **Agent will populate this section after user input** to demonstrate understanding of constitutional constraints.
>
> Example format:
> - **Q:** Can Platform Governor override Genesis certification rejection?  
>   **A:** No - Genesis authority is constitutionally protected (L1 governance). Governor can escalate to Vision Guardian for review, but cannot directly override.
>
> - **Q:** How does precedent seed supersession preserve audit trail?  
>   **A:** Immutable append-only logs (audit_log.jsonl with hash chains). Supersession creates new seed with reference to old seed_id, marks old as "superseded", never deletes.

## Gap Analysis Summary (Post-User Input)

**Total Gaps:** [To be determined after constitutional audit]

**Categories:**
- Critical: [Count TBD]
- High Priority: [Count TBD]
- Medium: [Count TBD]
- Constitutional Compliance: [Count TBD]

**Resolution Strategy:** [Agent will define after gap identification]

## Next Steps

1. **User shares high-level Plant journey** (screens, workflows, interactions)
2. **Agent validates constitutional fitment** (L0/L1 compliance audit)
3. **Agent expands detailed journey** (gaps, solutions, self-answered questions)
4. **Review and iterate** (user feedback on constitutional interpretation)
5. **Finalize specification** (ready for implementation phase)
