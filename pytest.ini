# NOTE: This repo contains multiple backend subprojects under `src/**/BackEnd/` with
# overlapping package names (`api`, `models`, `services`) and separate test setups.
# Collecting them all from the monorepo root causes import/collection conflicts.
# The root test suite is therefore scoped to the top-level `tests/` folder.
