feat(orchestration): Complete Epic 3.3 Orchestration Runtime ✨

Epic 3.3: Orchestration Runtime (30/30 points) - COMPLETE

Delivered complete task orchestration system enabling complex multi-agent
workflows with dependency management, parallel execution, fault tolerance,
and distributed transaction support.

Stories Completed:
- Story 1 (8 pts): Task Queue Core - Priority-based queuing with lifecycle management
- Story 2 (6 pts): Dependency Resolution - DAG validation with topological sort
- Story 3 (6 pts): Parallel Execution - Dynamic worker pools with load balancing
- Story 4 (5 pts): Retry & Compensation - Exponential backoff and saga pattern
- Story 5 (5 pts): Integration Tests - End-to-end validation of complete stack

- Total: 2,420 lines

Test Coverage:
- 119 unit tests (100% passing)
- 12 integration tests (100% passing)
- Total: 131 tests
- Coverage: ~90%
