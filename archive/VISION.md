# WAOOAW Vision

**The First AI Agent Marketplace That Makes You Say WOW**

---

## Mission

To build the first marketplace where **specialized AI agents earn your business by demonstrating value before payment**. Agents have personality, specialization, status, and reputation - just like hiring talent.

- **Keep deliverables**: Customers keep all work even if they cancel
- **Zero risk**: No commitment, full transparency
- **Agent quality**: Only capable agents earn recurring business
